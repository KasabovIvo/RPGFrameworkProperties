action.add_edge_pool.desc=Add your Edge as a dice pool bonus to your roll, and make 6s explode. “Exploding” means that 6s count as a hit and can be rerolled in an attempt to get an additional hit. If another hit is scored,tack it on; if another 6 is rolled, tack on a hit and roll it again. Keep the hits coming! If a 1 is rolled after a 6, it does not count toward your total for calculating glitches.
action.aimbot.desc=Use your onboard controls and tools to your advantage. If you score at least one net hit on an attack using a vehicle-mounted weapon, gain additional net hits equal to your vehicle’s Sensor rating.
action.anticipation.desc=For you combat is like a game of chess, and you’re several moves ahead of the opposition. When performing this Multiple Attack, double your full dice pool and then split it as evenly as possible for each different target. Cost: 4 Edge
action.assembled_with_love.desc=Using Juryrigging on adding a modification to a vehicle or drone allows for the modification to last for (net hits) hours with a successful test. Once the repaired object stops functioning, it cannot be repaired, only rebuilt from scratch. Only 1 modification can be juryrigged to a vehicle at a time.
action.attack_run.desc=When piloting a vehicle, combine with an Engineering (Gunnery) Major Action to add your ranks in Piloting to your dice pool for one attack with a vehicle-mounted weapon or ramming attack. Any attacks made against your vehicle for the remainder of this combat round gain an Edge. Holding your action to fire last in the Initiative order is valid and a fair price to pay to avoid the defensive penalty.
action.big_speech.desc=A torrent of words flows from your mouth, reaching heights of eloquence and inspiration mortals rarely hit. Roll your Influence + Charisma test twice; the first time it counts as a Teamwork test, meaning you can add your hits to the dice pool for the second roll. The second roll acts as your hits for the test.
action.black_thumb.desc=Using rush job rules (p. 165), the character can attempt repairs to the vehicle while the vehicle is moving. Rules for gaining Fatigue still apply.
action.blinding_strike.desc=(Any Attack, Blind) This special attack goes after the eyes of opponents. This can be as direct as an eye gouge or indirect, like cutting the face near the eyes so that blood impedes vision. If net hits on an attack roll are higher than the Agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Blind I status. This status adds more levels of Blind if the opponent already had that status. Duration of the inflicted status is a number of combat rounds equal the net hits on the attack. No other damage occurs from the attack.
action.bootleg_turn.desc=(Piloting) If you are the chase target, perform a sudden sharp turn to change directions. You may adjust the relative position of all participants in the chase one range category closer or farther away from you.
action.bring_the_drama.desc=While spinning your con, you get to a part where extra drama would be appropriate, and you bring it. Maybe it’s a dramatic speech, maybe it’s some tears or sorrowful histrionics, but whatever the case, you take action to tug at the heartstrings of the mark and bring them to your side. For a quick con, this can bring in 200 nuyen from onlookers. When used as part of a longer-term con, you can increase your asking price by twenty percent, and the mark will agree to it.
action.buy_auto_hit.desc=You get an automatic hit. This one adds on to the total hits you roll. This isn’t an automatic success at whatever test you’re attempting, just another hit to add to your total.
action.called_shot_break_weapon.desc=Break Weapon (Any Attack) If you can’t disarm your opponent, or you just want to show off, you can direct your attack against your opponent’s weapon to disable it. The Attack roll is the similar to breaking through barriers (p. 111, SR6). If the modified DV exceeds half of the Structure rating for the weapon (see Weapon Structure Ratings table) corresponding to the weapon, the Attack Rating of the weapon is reduced by 1 permanently in all range categories. If the DV exceeds the Structure rating, reduce the Attack Rating by the difference between DV and the Structure rating. If the Attack Rating is reduced to 0 in a range category, the weapon cannot be used at that distance (p. 109, SR6). If there is no Attack Rating available in any range category, it’s time to buy a new one, as this one’s busted.
action.called_shot_disarm.desc=Successful hit does no damage to target, but their weapon is knocked from their hands.
action.called_shot_incapacitate.desc=Incapacitate (Any Attack) If you can’t take your opponent in a fair fight, try inflicting a concussion first. With this called shot, if the number of net hits exceeds the Reaction attribute of the target, that character receives the Dazed status with a duration of a number of combat rounds equal to the net hits.
action.called_shot_vitals.desc=The attack goes for the vitals, adding 3 extra damage if  it hits (along with net hits, as usual).
action.change_environment_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You use your knowledge of the area to change the playing field, moving toward an environment that better suits you. Starting next combat round, change the environment to Open, Restricted, or Tight.
action.change_environment_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You use your knowledge of the area to change the playing field, moving toward an environment that better suits you. Starting next combat round, change the environment to Open, Restricted, or Tight.
action.charge.desc=(Melee Attack, Move Action) You throw yourself body and soul into the attack, hoping to bring both the pain and some staggering power. After moving at least 5 meters, you make the attack against your opponent. Net hits can be transferred from damage to movement; for each point transferred, the damage is reduced by one, and the opponent is moved one meter. The attacker can transfer damage in an amount equal to or less than their Body rating. If the attack damages the opponent, calculate the possibility of knocking the opponent prone as if the damage value was 2 higher than it was after the transfer.
action.chicken.desc=(Piloting) Choose a target vehicle that is involved in a chase with you. At the end of this round, whichever of you got fewer net hits on their Piloting test must make a Crash test or crash. You may not use this Edge action within an open environment.
action.count_2_glitch.desc=Time to get counteroffensive! When an opponent rolls, both 1s and 2s count in their total to determine if they glitch or critical glitch.
action.cover_fire.desc=(BF or FA Attack) To put it simply, you spray a whole lot of bullets in the direction of your opponent to put them in an inconvenient position that your allies take advantage of as a kind of Cover. Your firearm must be firing in Burst Fire or Full Auto mode. When using Burst Fire, instead of increasing the DV of the weapon by 1 against the two opponents, you give two allies a +2 to Cover (up to Cover IV) if the targeted opponents retaliate. With Full Auto, reduce the DV of the weapon by 2 and your allies receive Cover IV in relation to opponents that are targeted.
action.create_special.desc=Bring your creativity to the table! You spend this Edge and something fortuitous happens. It’s up to you and your gamemaster to determine what it is, but it should certainly turn the tides slightly in your favor. Burst pipes, approaching sirens, incoming DocWagon, an angry spirit, something that adds a little more oomph to your side or puts a little stress on the enemy.
action.crossfire.desc=This Edge Action must be declared before making a defense test to avoid an attack against a vehicle that you are piloting. You draw fire towards another target while narrowly evading an attack against yourself. Choose another target within Close or Near range of your vehicle. Any net hits on your defense test count as hits against your chosen target instead. Your target gets a Defense test to avoid the incoming fire, but they may not gain or spend Edge on it. The base damage of the attack is exactly the same as the attack against you, as are any effects related to the attack. \r\n Example: Johnny Redline is being chased by a pair of go-gangers. Two of them are right on his tail, within close range. One of them takes a shot at him with the flamethrower mounted on the front of his bike, but Johnny is sitting on plenty of Edge. He decides to go for a Crossfire action, chooses the other ganger at Close range as his target, and spends 5 Edge. He gets 3 net hits on his Defense test, so when he hits the brakes and swerves to the side to avoid the stream of fire, he manages to angle the incoming line of fire into the path of the other ganger. The surprised ganger only gets 2 hits on a Defense test, which leaves one net hit. Instead of Johnny’s ride going up in flames, one of his antagonists gets to feel the burn. They’ll take damage from the flamethrower, with +1 DV due to the net hit.
action.dead_stop.desc=(Outdoors [Navigation]) When pursuing, make an Outdoors (Navigation) + Intuition vs. Outdoors (Navigation) + Intuition Opposed test. If you succeed, the chase target’s understanding of the area fails them and they make a wrong turn into a dead end. This ends the chase. At least one combat round must pass before a new chase can be initiated.
action.double_down1.desc=Add up to 1 wild dice to a test. You may add this either before or after you roll, with the full knowledge that the wild dice might help you or make things worse. If any wild dice rolls a 1, all 5s are ignored, including 5s on other wild dice.
action.double_down2.desc=Add up to 2 wild dice to a test. You may add this either before or after you roll, with the full knowledge that the wild dice might help you or make things worse. If any wild dice rolls a 1, all 5s are ignored, including 5s on other wild dice.
action.double_down3.desc=Add up to 3 wild dice to a test. You may add this either before or after you roll, with the full knowledge that the wild dice might help you or make things worse. If any wild dice rolls a 1, all 5s are ignored, including 5s on other wild dice.
action.drafting.desc=(Piloting) If there is at least one other participant ahead of you in Close or Near range, move ahead one range category relative to the chase target.
action.emergency_boost.desc=Temporarily increase a Matrix attribute by 1 for one test.
action.entanglement.desc=(Grapple Attack with Exotic Weapon) Exotic weapons such as whips, chains, bolos, and lariats have the capabilities of entangling an opponent. When used as part of grapple, roll Exotic Weapon + Agility vs. Agility + Reaction. If net hits of the attack exceed the opponent’s Agility, the weapon has entangled the opponent, and they gain the Hobbled status for a number of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits.
action.equalizer_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) Whether or not you succeed on your Piloting or Athletics test, you remove everyone’s position advantages for the remainder of the combat round.
action.equalizer_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) Whether or not you succeed on your Piloting or Athletics test, you remove everyone’s position advantages for the remainder of the combat round.
action.escape_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) When you are the chase target, if all pursuers are at Extreme range in a vehicle chase or at least Medium range in a foot chase, you escape. Any pursuers within Extreme range in a vehicle chase (or Medium range or greater in a foot chase) must get as many net hits as your Piloting or Athletics test or fall out of the chase, either stopping or heading in a wrong direction.
action.escape_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) When you are the chase target, if all pursuers are at Extreme range in a vehicle chase or at least Medium range in a foot chase, you escape. Any pursuers within Extreme range in a vehicle chase (or Medium range or greater in a foot chase) must get as many net hits as your Piloting or Athletics test or fall out of the chase, either stopping or heading in a wrong direction.
action.evade_pursuit1.desc=(Piloting, Chase Target Only) Move ahead and away from all pursuit. Increase the range categories of all other participants relative to you by one. Any pursuit that was already at Extreme range remains within that range category. You also gain a position advantage against all of your pursuers.
action.evade_pursuit2.desc=(Piloting, Chase Target Only) Move ahead and away from all pursuit. Increase the range categories of all other participants relative to you by two. Any pursuit that was already at Extreme range remains within that range category. You also gain a position advantage against all of your pursuers.
action.evasive_action.desc=Add your ranks in Piloting to a Defense test against a vehicle you are piloting.
action.fake_out.desc=(Any Attack) Your strategy in this attack is not to kill or maim, but to distract, putting your opponent off balance or giving them a false feeling of success that puts them at a disadvantage when they take the bait. Roll an attack against the opponent. Instead of doing damage, net hits lower the opponent’s Defense Rating for the next combat round on a one-to-one basis (the weapon’s DV has no effect). This new Defense Rating is used by any attacker targeting this individual.
action.fire_from_cover.desc=(Ranged Attack, must be in Cover IV): You sneak an attack out while maintaining your cover. Attacks from cover may be made without spending a Minor Action.
action.focus_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) Count your vehicle’s Handling as 1 lower for this Piloting test, or reduce the threshold for your Athletics (Sprinting) test by 1.
action.focus_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) Count your vehicle’s Handling as 1 lower for this Piloting test, or reduce the threshold for your Athletics (Sprinting) test by 1.
action.freerunning.desc=(Sprint) Through a series of gymnastic maneuvers, the character can move quickly through and up terrain obstacles. This Edge Action allows both horizontal and vertical movement in one Major Action (instead of multiple Minor Actions). While sprinting, the character can remove hits from the Sprint action and use them to gain vertical distance (climbing both up and down), up to their Agility in meters. Movement with Parkour must end on a horizontal surface (or foothold/handhold), otherwise you fall down. The gamemaster determines if there is enough terrain to ascend or descend vertically and if there’s a foothold or handhold. An adept with Wall Running ability who uses the Freeruning Action increases their base Sprint distance to 18 meters.
action.give_ally_1_edge.desc=You do something that offers an advantage for another member of your team. Take away two of your own Edge, and give one to a teammate.
action.greaser.desc=When you deploy your oil slick against a single target behind you within Close or Near range, they may not gain or spend Edge on their Crash test.
action.hamstring.desc=(Any Attack) This action covers any attack aimed at the hamstring, knee, or other parts of the leg with the express purpose of slowing down an opponent. With the attack roll, if net successes exceed the agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Hobbled status with a duration of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.heal_1_physic.desc=You take off a single box of damage from your Physical Condition Monitor—your advantage over your opponents means they didn’t hit you quite as hard as they first thought.
action.heal_1_stun.desc=You catch a second wind and clear a box from your Stun Condition Monitor.
action.hit_the_brakes.desc=(Piloting) If you are the chase target, abruptly decelerate. All other participants in the chase are adjusted one range category closer relative to your position.
action.hog.desc=Blast a host or persona with recursive requests, eating up valuable resources and lowering its Data Processing by 2 and active program slots by 1 for (Attack Rating) rounds.
action.i_saw_it_in_a_trid_once.desc=A character may use any martial arts technique they haven’t spent Karma to learn as part of their next action. This use of Edge may not have its cost reduced by martial arts techniques the user has already spent Karma to learn.
action.imposing_stone.desc=(Intercept) Imposing Stone allows the character not only to intercept the opponent, but to prevent them from moving past them. Each success reduces the opponent’s movement by 1 meter. If the attack exceeds the opponent’s Agility, then the opponent stops next to the character.
action.in_the_zone.desc=You are feeling the flow of the vehicle’s movement and know how to make it do what you want—at least for now. Ignore any penalties affecting your vehicle’s Handling on this test.
action.intimidating_presence.desc=(Use Skill (Influence)) Sometimes, you just want to stand tall, flex some muscles, and speak in a commanding voice instead of having to shiv another round of gangers in the gut. Intimidating Presence can let punks know that you’re not to be messed with. To use it, a character rolls Influence + Strength vs. Willpower + Strength; net hits reduce opponents’ Attack Rating for that combat round on a one-to-one basis. If net hits exceed the opponent’s Attack Rating value, then the opponent cannot gain or spend Edge for the entire subsequent combat round.
action.karmic_escape.desc=(Dodge) It’s not the incoming damage that’s worrying. It’s what it can do to your DocWagon premium. To use this action, characters must have attempted to dodge or block an attack that could inflict a status (Blind, Deafened, etc.) and failed. The character can then spend Edge and a Minor Action to attempt to avoid the status they would have received, at the cost of taking damage. Resolve the attack as if the net hits did damage rather than inflicting the status.
action.knockout_blow.desc=You use your advantage to truly bring the hurt on an opponent. If your inflicted damage of any type is greater than the target’s Willpower, immediately fill up the Stun Condition Monitor. The target is unconscious. No damage overflows to the Physical Condition Monitor.
action.knuckle_breaker.desc=(Any attack) As the name suggests, the attack is designed to neutralize the opponent’s effectiveness in combat or ability to escape. Character targets a specific limb (left leg, right arm, etc.). This called shot has a –4 dice pool penalty. If the attack is successful, that limb takes on Disabled status (see p. 106). If the net hits exceed the Body of the opponent, the limb takes on Disabled II status. The status lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to net hits. This attack can be repeated on the same limb to increase the Disabled status level (up to DisabledIII). With every attack, the duration is cumulative.
action.leaf_on_the_wind.desc=(Sprint) Through a series of gymnastic maneuvers, the character takes advantage of the surrounding terrain, doing things like moving to give a smaller or obscured profile to attack, sliding through railings, flipping over benches, getting hang time off a room corner, or whatever other creative move they can come up with. While sprinting, the character can remove successes from the Sprint action and use them as cover, up to a status of Cover IV, lasting one combat round. Treat additional actions as if they performed in Cover, including gaining and using Edge. The gamemaster determines if there is enough terrain to gain the Cover status. The Wall Running adept ability gives Cover I status automatically when using this action, as no one expects you to run up the freaking wall to escape.
action.monkey_climb.desc=(Climb) You are not one to keep your feet on the ground. There’s a missing bit of fear as you cross empty air, going from handhold to handhold, barely looking to see if you’re arriving anywhere safe. Change climb distance to 1.2 meters per hit (characters with Long Reach increase the distance to 1.3 meters).
action.negate_1_edge.desc=No sense in letting the bad guys get the best of you if you don’t need to. You spend two of your own Edge, but one vanishes from the opponent of your choice.
action.pickup.desc=This is a tricky vehicle action where the pilot slides their vehicle toward a target and picks them up without stopping. The vehicle must have a vehicle entrance wide enough to pick up the target, most often an open door or seating space such as on a motorcycle. If successful, the target is considered inside or on the vehicle. Passenger takes 5 boxes of Stun damage (unresisted) with a successful maneuver. Net hits can reduce that damage by 1 per hit. In cases of failure, see Crashing, p. 200, SR6.
action.pin.desc=(Thrown Weapon or Projectile Weapon Attack) You’ve probably seen an action scene where a target is pinned to the wall with an arrow or knife or something to immobilize an opponent. This isn’t easy, in part because it’s more instinctive to aim for vital areas. With this attack, if the number of hits exceeded the Defense Rating of the target, regardless if whether attack inflicted actual any damage or not, then the opponent has been pinned to the wall or floor, giving them the Immobilized status. The opponent must spend a Pick Up/Put Down Object action to remove the Immobilized status.
action.playing_possum.desc=(Use Skill (Influence)) You are not quite dead yet, but you want to bluff your opponent into thinking you are done for or are more injured than you actually are. The character rolls Influence + Charisma vs. Willpower + Intuition. The gamemaster may include a dice pool adjustment for the believability of the particular circumstances. If successful, the character gains a dice pool bonus equal to net hits for the next attack against the opponent. If the character fails to bluff their opponent, the opponent gains a dice pool bonus equal to their net hits on their defense test. The gamemaster can wait to reveal whether the Playing Possum action succeeded or failed until the subsequent attack is made.
action.plus_1_roll.desc=You get to add 1 to a single die. Maybe that’s making a 4 a 5 to get another hit, or making 1 a 2 to avoid a glitch.
action.plus_3_ini.desc=This one kicks in before combat even starts. You can choose to spend one point of Edge to increase your Initiative Score by 3. It can also be used during the fight if you want to move up in the order on the next Initiative Cycle.
action.point_defense.desc=This Edge Action allows you to make an attack against an incoming missile, torpedo, or launched grenade as a Major Action. You may only use this Edge action if you are the direct target of the attack, or if you are within a vehicle that is under attack. You must also have a ranged weapon at the ready, loaded and ready to fire. The threshold for the shot is 5. Any successful hit detonates the explosive before it reaches its target. If you attempt this action and fail, you may not gain or spend Edge on your defense test against the attack.
action.protect_the_principal.desc=(Intercept) Self-sacrifice is sometimes necessary in getting the job done. If you can move to an ally in 1 Minor Action, then you take the damage from the opponent instead of the ally. There is no option to block or dodge this attack.
action.recover.desc=You spend a Major Action to recover from one debilitating status effect during this encounter or reduce the effect by 1 if it has multiple levels.
action.redline.desc=(Piloting) When you change position in a vehicle chase, you may move up to two range categories relative to the chase target. Your vehicle takes 4P damage (unresisted). If you are the chase target, you instead prevent any pursuers from gaining on you for the remainder of the combat round.
action.reroll_failed.desc=Pretty much what it says—after a roll is made, you can reroll all failed dice. This Edge Boost cannot be used if a glitch or critical glitch is rolled.
action.reroll_one.desc=Pick any die and reroll it. It can be yours or your opponent’s, but the result stands no matter what you roll. This is done after all rolls have been made.
action.riggers_advantage.desc=Riggers feel that the way they control vehicles and drones gives them a certain intangible advantage over others. Use this action to show that’s the case. Add your control rig’s rating to your total hits on this test.
action.right_back_at_ya.desc=(Avoid incoming) In an almost insane attempt at survival, this action has you grabbing a live grenade and trying to throwing it away. Avoid Incoming puts you at ground zero of the grenade attack. You then spend a Pickup action and roll Athletics + Reaction (2) to attempt to knock the grenade away. Net hits are subtracted from scatter distance of the original throw as you attempt to send it back where it came from. The gamemaster then re-rolls the scatter direction.
action.riposte.desc=(Block) This action allows the character to not only attempt to block an attack but possibly give a little damage back. First, the expenditure of Edge allows the character to decrease the base damage by 2P. If their Defense test is successful, the attacker is hit with damage equal to the net hits on the Defense test.
action.rolling_clouds.desc=(Falling) If you’re lucky enough (relatively speaking) to fall next to terrain such as a wall, cliff, or trees that you can reach, you may attempt to leverage kinetic forces to slow down your fall to something less than terminal. With an Athletics + Agility test, each success extends the number of meters that you can fall without suffering damage. For example, if you fall 15 meters and roll 3 hits, you get the base 3 meters of safe falling plus 3 more safe meters from Rolling Clouds, meaning the damaging part of your fall is 9 meters, making the damage 4P instead of 6P.
action.rooted.desc=(Move) When someone tries to knock you down, you have the quick sense to adjust your center of gravity to cancel out the force that’s knocking you to the ground. The character rolls Agility + Athletics and adds their hits to their Body rating for purposes of checking if they are knocked down (p. 110, SR6) or against a Trip or Tumble (p. 43, SR6).
action.shank.desc=When attacking with a blade, your advantage turns into a targeted strike. Reduce the Call a Shot penalty to –2.
action.signal_scream.desc=The next action ignores any penalty from noise.
action.smoke_screen1.desc=(Activate Smokescreen, Minor Action) Maneuver to spread the smoke launched from your vehicle’s smoke launcher for best advantage. Gain Cover I, but only against attacks from behind you.
action.smoke_screen2.desc=(Activate Smokescreen, Minor Action) Maneuver to spread the smoke launched from your vehicle’s smoke launcher for best advantage. Gain Cover II, but only against attacks from behind you.
action.smoke_screen3.desc=(Activate Smokescreen, Minor Action) Maneuver to spread the smoke launched from your vehicle’s smoke launcher for best advantage. Gain Cover III, but only against attacks from behind you.
action.smoke_screen4.desc=(Activate Smokescreen, Minor Action) Maneuver to spread the smoke launched from your vehicle’s smoke launcher for best advantage. Gain Cover IV, but only against attacks from behind you.
action.subtle_pilot.desc=(Piloting) Add bonus dice equal to your ranks in Piloting to a single Stealth test, but only when piloting a vehicle or drone.
action.sucker_punch.desc=(Any Melee Attack, Fatigued) This is all about playing outside Queensbury rules, unleashing a sucker punch to get that first hit in before the opponent is ready, or some other form of dirty fighting. With the attack roll, if net hits exceed the Willpower of the opponent, the opponent gains the Fatigued status with a duration of a number of combat rounds equal to net hits. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.sudden_insight.desc=Perform an action in which you have no skill levels without penalty. This does not allow you to use skills that cannot be performed untrained.
action.tactical_roll_htd.desc=You drop to avoid incoming fire, with an agile roll that helps you make an attack as you roll. If you use a melee Attack action on the same combat round, you do not get the dice pool penalty that comes with the Prone status (p. 53) or Hit the Dirt Action (p. 41). For the next round, you do not take the –2 dice pool penalty from Close or Near attacks that come with the Prone status.
action.taunt.desc=(Use Skill (Influence)) Someone is always going to pick on the mage first. There are even slogans about it. If it’s your mage, then you need to get the pressure off them. One option is to suggest that the opponent to pick on someone their own size. A successful taunt will get into the opponent’s head and distract them from beating said mage, or goad them into some other action. A character can taunt an opponent with Influence + Charisma vs. Willpower + Intuition test. Net hits increase the Defense Rating of the ally against that opponent for one combat round.
action.technobabble.desc=Can only be used by technomancers. Use Charisma instead of Logic on the next Matrix action.
action.the_exit.desc=With a successful Pilot test, the character reduces speed enough to safely exit the vehicle as an additional Minor Action. At 5+ hits, the vehicle comes to a complete stop without crashing; otherwise, the autopilot must make a Crash test.
action.threatening_edge.desc=(Block) The fast-spinning whirl of a staff, the flash of a half-meter of shiny metal, even the sound of a massive object moving through the air, knowing that it can easily crush bones, can be psychologically intimidating even for those not close by or holding a gun. No one wants to be the next target. The character includes a weapon performance as part of combat, giving opponents something to think about. For the duration of the encounter, while wielding a melee weapon, the character’s Defense Rating is replaced by the Close Attack Rating of the weapon.
action.throat_strike.desc=(Any melee attack) A good strike when you just want your opponent to shut the hell up with the descriptive expletives and just fight. With the attack roll, if net successes exceed the agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Muted status (p. 106). Duration of the inflicted status is equal the number of net hits in combat rounds. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.throw_person.desc=(Grapple) Once the opponent has been grappled, the attacker may pick up the opponent. The attacker makes a Close Combat + Strength vs. Strength + Reaction test. The attacker’s unarmed Attack Rating is used, and the defender suffers the –4 dice pool penalty for being restrained. If the attack is successful, the attacker inflicts their unarmed combat damage (Strength/2, rounded up) plus net hits. The character can remove successes from the combat damage and use them for distance thrown, up to Strength/2 meters. After the throw, the opponent is out of the grapple and gains the Prone status. The gamemaster can impose additional damage to the thrown character based on where they land (onto a bed of nails, out a window of a skyscraper, down an elevator shaft, etc.).
action.thunder_palm.desc=(Any Attack) A quick strike to the ears, and the opponent will be left unable to hear that awesome retort you just came up with. If net hits exceed the Willpower of the opponent, the opponent gains the Deafened status with a duration of a number of Combat Rounds equal the number of net hits. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.tokyo_drift.desc=(Piloting) If you are the chase target, performing a successful Drift action prevents anyone else from changing their position unless they get at least as many net hits as you on their Piloting test.
action.tuck_and_roll.desc=(Character receives Pron status) You’re already going down from some attack (any attack that ended with the character prone), so you might as well hit the ground on your own terms. You may move up to 1 meter from the original location where you were going to be lying (which may put you at a different range category from the opponent or closer to cover). You are still prone, and the Prone status still applies.
action.tumble.desc=Your advantages combine to give you the chance to not just hurt your opponent but bring them to the ground. If the damage being inflicted on a target is greater than the target’s Body, they are brought down, giving them the Prone status.
action.under_the_radar.desc=The next illegal action performed on this turn does not increase OS. That does not mean the action and any subsequent actions automatically become legal—it just means the OS does not increase.
action.up_the_ante1_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You decide to take a challenging route and see if others can keep up. You may only take this Edge Action when you are the target of a chase and you are in a tight environment. Add a penalty to your Handling (or increase the threshold of your Athletics test) of 1. Any pursuers must either accept that penalty or fall out of the chase and lose track of you.
action.up_the_ante1_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You decide to take a challenging route and see if others can keep up. You may only take this Edge Action when you are the target of a chase and you are in a tight environment. Add a penalty to your Handling (or increase the threshold of your Athletics test) of 1. Any pursuers must either accept that penalty or fall out of the chase and lose track of you.
action.up_the_ante2_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You decide to take a challenging route and see if others can keep up. You may only take this Edge Action when you are the target of a chase and you are in a tight environment. Add a penalty to your Handling (or increase the threshold of your Athletics test) of 2. Any pursuers must either accept that penalty or fall out of the chase and lose track of you.
action.up_the_ante2_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You decide to take a challenging route and see if others can keep up. You may only take this Edge Action when you are the target of a chase and you are in a tight environment. Add a penalty to your Handling (or increase the threshold of your Athletics test) of 2. Any pursuers must either accept that penalty or fall out of the chase and lose track of you.
action.up_the_ante3_a.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You decide to take a challenging route and see if others can keep up. You may only take this Edge Action when you are the target of a chase and you are in a tight environment. Add a penalty to your Handling (or increase the threshold of your Athletics test) of 3. Any pursuers must either accept that penalty or fall out of the chase and lose track of you.
action.up_the_ante3_p.desc=(Piloting or Athletics) You decide to take a challenging route and see if others can keep up. You may only take this Edge Action when you are the target of a chase and you are in a tight environment. Add a penalty to your Handling (or increase the threshold of your Athletics test) of 3. Any pursuers must either accept that penalty or fall out of the chase and lose track of you.
action.weapon_flash.desc=(Quick Draw, Attack) This Edge Action allows the Quick Draw Action to be applied to any melee weapon. The Attack Action must be used in conjunction with this action.
action.weapon_spread.desc=For the duration of the encounter, while wielding two melee weapons, Close range is extended by 2 meters.
action.wrest.desc=When in melee combat, if you successfully Block an attack, you can use this action to wrest your opponent’s weapon away. Roll Close Combat + Agility, with the attacker’s Strength as the threshold. If you equal the threshold, you knock the weapon out of their hands, and it falls to the ground. If you get more hits, you take the weapon from them. If you get fewer hits, the attacker retains the weapon.
action.yielding_force.desc=(Trip) Instead of using force to counter force, you attempt to leverage the force and momentum of the attacker and knock them off balance. Instead of blocking the attack, the defender bends out of the way, throwing the opponent off balance—and hopefully on the ground. Character rolls Athletics + Agility as the defense test against the attack. If net hits exceed the Agility of the opponent, then the character takes no damage, and the opponent receives the Prone status. Otherwise, resolve as if the character was dodging.
adeptpower.adrenaline_boost.desc=You get a surge of energy so you can get the jump on others. For each level of the power, add 2 to your initiative score for (Magic) combat rounds. At the the end of those combat rounds, experience drain equal to the level of the power, which you can resist as normal.
adeptpower.aid_sorcery.desc=An adept with this power can channel their inner magic to aid a nearby spellcaster with their sorcery. The adept must touch the spellcaster and spend a Major Action to open a mana conduit between them, and they must maintain physical contact and spend a Minor Action every subsequent round to keep the conduit open. A spellcaster that casts a spell while a conduit is maintained in this way adds the adept’s Aid Sorcery ranks as bonus dice on any Sorcery test (also including Counterspelling and Ritual Spellcasting). After each time a spellcaster uses these bonus dice, the adept must resist drain in the form of Stun damage equal to their ranks in Aid Sorcery. Using Air Dance lets a particularly speedy adept capitalize on their reaction time against slower opponents, gliding smoothly on air with their feet just a centimeter off the ground. At the start of the round, compare the adept’s initiative to the highest initiative on the opposing side. For every (10 –Initiate Grade) Initiative Points that the adept beats their fastest opponent by, the adept gains +1 Minor Action.
adeptpower.analytics.desc=Adepts with this power recognize and solve patterns and puzzles with supernatural ease. They gain a bonus Edge when making any Logic-based test (this Edge must be spent on that test, or it is lost).
adeptpower.animal_empathy.desc=Some adepts have an uncanny ability to connect making any Charisma-based test against mundane critters. The second level of Animal Empathy grants the same bonus with Awakened critters—including dracoforms, the Infected, and the like. Good luck with that!
adeptpower.astral_perception.desc=You gain the ability to astrally perceive and follow the rules involved in so doing (see p. 159). You are dual-natured while using this power and can attack astral forms.
adeptpower.attribute_boost.desc=Mana flows into your body and enhances your inherent abilities, carrying you to a superior level. When purchasing this ability, it must be applied to a specific Physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reaction, or Strength); if this power is purchased multiple times, it can be used to either increase the rank connected to an already-selected attribute (up to 6) or to apply to a new attribute. It cannot be applied to Mental or Special attributes. When this power is activated, roll Magic + Attribute Boost rating. Each hit temporarily boosts the rating of the designated attribute by 1, up to the augmented maximum of +4. This only affects dice pools, so your Initiative rank, Condition Monitor, Defense Rating, and so forth is not changed. The effect lasts for (net hits) combat rounds, and when it runs out, the adept takes drain equal to the level of this power, resisted as normal.
adeptpower.attribute_boost_mental.desc=More refined adepts harness their internal mana flow and use it to empower not only their physical abilities, but their cleverness, perception, force of personality, and strength of will. When this ability is purchased, you specify a Mental attribute (Logic, Intuition, Charisma, or Willpower; this power can be purchased multiple times, either adding ranks to an existing Boost or applying it to a new attribute). This power cannot be applied to Physical or Special attributes. When this power is activated, roll Magic + (Attribute Boost rating for relevant attribute). Each hit temporarily increases the rating of the designated attribute by 1, up to the augmented maximum of +4. This affects only dice pools, not Initiative rank, Condition Monitor, etc. The effect lasts for (net hits) rounds, and when the power expires, the adept must resist drain equal to their levels in this power in the relevant attribute.
adeptpower.berserk.desc=Some adepts are wells of furious mana and hinstance) they must roll an Adept Drain test (Body + Willpower, or as appropriate for their way) and score hits equal to their ranks in the Berserk power. When the power expires, either naturally or through a voluntary withdrawal, the adept must resist drain equal to (2 x ranks in this power), using their regular (non-Berserk) drain attributes.
adeptpower.blind_fighting.desc=An adept with this power uses some combination of other senses to reflexively compensate for a lack of vision, whether due to permanent injury, temporary penalties, or a simple blindfold. An adept using Blind Fighting never grants a Close Combat opponent bonus Edge for vision modifiers (for darkness, flash-paks, tear gas, or other vision-based penalties), but they are still vulnerable to ambush or surprise situations.
adeptpower.cloak.desc=Some auras are harder to draw a bead on than others. For every rank an adept has in the Cloak power, they may impose a –1 dice pool penalty to tests made to read their aura.
adeptpower.combat_sense.desc=This power gives you the ability to anticipate and avoid harm. Gain a +1 dice pool bonus per level on any defensive tests. This bonus also applies to any surprise tests (p. 108) you make.
adeptpower.commanding_voice.desc=The words of an adept with Commanding Voice are infused with supernatural authority and power. Every level of this power adds +1 die to opposed Influence tests for Intimidation that the character initiates, while also lacing those forceful commands with unstoppable intent. If the adept succeeds in such a test, the target must obey the adept’s given order, at least momentarily. Dangerous orders or orders given in dangerous situations (in combat, for instance) will be followed for a maximum of (Commanding Voice) rounds. Orders may never result in the target directly harming themselves (“leap off the roof,” “step into traffic,” and “shoot yourself” are not valid commands, for instance), though they may result in a moment of vulnerability that can be taken advantage of (“sit” or “freeze”) or a momentary shift in allegiance (“shoot that guard!”). When in doubt, a successful order should at least make a target freeze up for at least one full round, even if the order given is impossible or clearly suicidal. Clearly supernatural orders will leave a target aware of this external control, but less radical commands may result in longer obedience, and if phrased carefully may not even result in the target or other witnesses being aware of any supernatural manipulation (though they’ll still likely notice someone barking orders and those orders being obeyed, the magical control itself may not be obvious). “Come on, man, just let us in” may get you into a club without incident, while a shouted “fight him, muwahaha” and setting a bouncer against his coworker for your amusement is likely to draw attention and be pretty obvious.
adeptpower.cool_resolve.desc=Some adepts shield their psyches with mana and certainty, making themselves impressively unflappable. For every level in Cool Resolve, they may add +1 die to all opposed social tests to resist someone else’s initiated Influence skills, and +1 die on all tests to resist the Fear critter power. (They may add these dice, not must, allowing them to benefit from friendly Leadership or Instruction rolls, etc.).
adeptpower.cosmetic_control.desc=An adept with Cosmetic Control may alter their body in order to change their physical appearance by growing or shedding hair, changing traditional gender markers, altering their skin tone, adding or removing blemishes or scars, reshaping their facial features, changing their height and weight, or increasing or decreasing other cosmetic physical attributes (bust and hip size, growing or retracting nails, etc.). These changes are purely cosmetic but are not illusory, and clothing and other equipment are not affected, nor may damage be healed in this way, augmentations expelled or installed, etc. One level of Cosmetic Control allows for the adept to change within the confines of what is normally allowed for their metatype (ears remain pointed or round as appropriate, trolls maintain horns and orks tusks, height remains within the range of their metatype, and hair, eye, and skin colors are limited to the usual range of their metatype). The second level of Cosmetic Control allows an adept to reach beyond the usual limitations of their metaspecies, in both general appearance (ear shape, the addition or removal of horns or tusks, etc.) and in size, allowing a dwarf to reach human/elven/orkish height (or reduce themselves to a smaller size, such as a pixie), allowing a troll to reduce to human/elven/orkish height, or allowing a human/elf/ork to grow or shrink to either extreme. These modifications still provide no alteration to attributes in any way, but they are enough to allow an adept to pass completely as a member of a different metatype. It also allows for a broader array of other cosmetic changes, such as hair, skin, and eye colors and patterns with a greater variety (striped blue hair, green skin, adding tattoos, slit eyes like a cat, or whatever other purely cosmetic modifications they like). Each level of Cosmetic Control, in addition to Edge Boosts by one for Con tests for Acting, Disguise, or Impersonation, as appropriate (and with the GM’s discretion may also add to Influence tests as well, particularly Intimidation as it relates to size, or metatype-related Etiquette tests). GMs and players should also remain aware of the Social Test Edge chart (SR6, p. 98) for further mechanical guidance as circumstances and appearances change.
adeptpower.countermagic.desc=Spells slide off an adept with this power like water off a duck’s back. An adept with Countermagic adds one die to tests to resist spells per level of this power.
adeptpower.counterstrike.desc=An adept with Counterstrike may smoothly shift from defense to attack in Close Combat, catching an opponent off-guard after successfully defending against an attack. This power may only be used on their first turn after successfully using a Minor Action to Block a Close Combat attack (p. 41, SR6). After spending an additional Minor Action to trigger Counterstrike, add dice to their next Close Combat attack roll equal to their levels in Counterstrike plus any net hits from the Block— but only on attacks against the character who attacked them.
adeptpower.critical_strike.desc=Increase the DV of your melee attacks by 1 per level of this power. This power is compatible with other enhancements from weapons and adept powers unless otherwise prohibited.
adeptpower.danger_sense.desc=You have a sixth sense for danger, instinctively knowing when it’s nearby and preparing for it. Gain an Edge before making Surprise tests.
adeptpower.dash.desc=Fleet of foot is putting it mildly! When an adept makes a Sprint test (p. 44, SR6) and invests a Minor Action to focus themselves, they add +1 meter to their movement for every rank in Dash.
adeptpower.direction_sense.desc=You have a good sense of where you have been, where you’re going, and a few of the obstacles in between. When making an Outdoors test related to directions, you may gain an Edge point, provided you spend it immediately on that test.
adeptpower.distance_grasp.desc=Distance Grasp lets an adept reach out and manipulate the physical world through a psychokinetic effect that roughly mimics their hands. The range of this power is (Distance Grasp levels x Magic) in meters, and the adept has an effective Strength equal to their levels in Distance Grasp. They may use skills remotely, pick up small objects, flip switches, peck at keyboards, pick locks, etc, but they may not attack (see Distance Strike for that). The supernatural intent behind Distance Grasp is for manipulation, not offense.
adeptpower.distance_strike.desc=An adept with Distance Strike may project their physical strength across short distances with the clear, mana-infused intent to deal damage, allowing them to strike a target without physically touching them. The range of a Distance Strike is the adept’s Magic in meters, and it deals damage and has an Attack Rating the same as the adept’s unarmed attacks (including supernatural or Essence-invested modifiers, such as Killing Hands, Elemental Strike, or Bone Lacing, but not purely external modifications like knucks or shock gloves). The adept attacks with Close Combat as though it were a regular Unarmed attack, but targets may resist the attack as either a Close Combat or ranged attack (using Dodge or Block as they prefer). Cover modifiers apply as usual, and the strike cannot pass through solid objects or pierce mana barriers.
adeptpower.elemental_missile.desc=Elemental Missile lets an adept infuse a ranged attack with an elemental damage type (see Damage Types, p. 109, SR6). Activating the power and visibly charging your weapon with elemental energy requires a Minor Action, after which time it remains active for (Magic) rounds or until deactivated at will. When Elemental Missile is purchased, the adept must choose one element and one type of ranged attack from the following list: Thrown Weapons (including attacks made with Missile Mastery), Projectile Weapons, one Specialization of the Exotic Weapon skill or one Specialization of Firearms (Automatics, Longarms, Pistols, Rifles, or Shotguns; the character need not have the specialization or expertise purchased, but the narrower categories apply to its use). Elemental Missile may also be purchased for the Gunnery specialization of Engineering, but the elemental effect can only be applied to Gunnery weapons if the adept has used Item Attunement to link to the drone or vehicle that holds the weapon. This power may be purchased multiple times, either to apply alternate (not multiple) elemental effects to one category of ranged attack, or to apply already-purchased elemental effects to a wider variety of weapons. Only one elemental effect can be active per attack.
adeptpower.elemental_strike.desc=Prerequisite: Killing Hands (p. 157, SR6) An adept with Elemental Strike may infuse their unarmed attacks with raw elemental force, adding an elemental damage type (see Damage Types, p. 109, SR6). Activating the power and visibly wreathing your hand, foot, or other striking body part with power requires a Minor Action, after which it remains active for (Magic) rounds or until deactivated at will. The power may be purchased multiple times, adding a new elemental option with each purchase, but only one elemental effect can be active per attack.
adeptpower.elemental_weapon.desc=An adept with Elemental Weapon is able to channel elemental power into their melee attacks with Close Combat weapons rather than unarmed attacks. They add an elemental damage type (see Damage Types, p. 109, SR6) to their weapon attacks. Activating the power and wreathing your weapon in visible elemental energy requires a Minor Action, after which time it remains active for (Magic) rounds or until deactivated at all. The power may be purchased multiple times, adding a new elemental option with each purchase, but only one elemental effect can be active per attack.
adeptpower.empathic_healing.desc=Adepts can, in times of crisis, link their health to that of an injured person, and pull the target’s injuries into their own body along this powerful, and painful, conduit. The adept begins the Empathic Healing process through physical contact with the target and a Magic + Willpower roll (threshold of 5 – target’s Essence). The adept removes 1 box of Physical or Overflow damage from the target per hit, simultaneously suffering 1 box of Stun damage for the first box of damage transferred this way, then Physical damage equal to the remaining boxes in future actions. Damage is transferred at the rate of 1 box per Major Action, during which time physical contact must be maintained. Injuries can only be affected once with Empathic Healing (but using Empathic Healing does not count toward the limit of one Healing spell per injury). Example: The team’s face has Essence 6 and has received 8 boxes of Physical damage from a rifle shot. The adept makes contact, spends a Major Action, rolls Magic + Willpower, gets 4 hits, then adds +1 hit for the target’s high Essence for a total of 5 hits. Immediately upon rolling, the face is lowered to 7 boxes of Physical damage and the adept receives 1 box of (unsoakable) Stun. During the next Major Action dedicated to the process, the face is lowered to 6 damage, and the adept takes 1 level of (unsoakable) Physical damage. If contact is maintained and the power is used for the full duration, at the end of the process the face will still have 3 boxes of Physical damage, and the adept will have 4 boxes of Physical damage and 1 box of Stun.
adeptpower.empathic_sense.desc=Empathic Sense allows adepts access to a weaker form of Assensing, allowing them to sense the true feelings and health of targets they can see. The adept spends a Minor Action and rolls Intuition + Perception, and gains information according to the Assensing Table (p. 159, SR6), but they are limited to the emotional state and the physical health of the target (maladies, injuries, toxins, whether the target is Awakened, mundane, a technomancer or Monad). If an adept makes an Opposed Social test against the target and is able to leverage information gathered via Empathic Sense, grant the adept Edge on that roll (which must be used only on that roll, or it is lost). If an adept with Empathic Sense later gains the ability for full Astral Sight, this Power Point may be reallocated.
adeptpower.enhanced_accuracy.desc=Weapons are more accurate and deadly in your hands than in those of normal people. Increase the Attack Rating of any weapon you wield by 2.
adeptpower.enhanced_perception.desc=Your senses are keenly honed, giving you information in enough time for you to figure out what to do about it. Gain an Edge when Observing in Detail or making a Perception test to find something hidden or listen to something you’re not supposed to hear.
adeptpower.enthralling_performance.desc=Enthralling Performance lets an adept lace an artistic performance with magical power in order to mesmerize their audience and, in fact, put them into a relaxed hypnotic state. By investing a Minor Action to harness their power (in addition to the necessary action investment to perform with their instrument, dance, sing, etc.), the adept may then roll their appropriate skill/specialty + Magic, and their hits serve as a threshold modifier for any Perception tests their audience might try to make during the performance. Enthralled audience members may be distracted and entranced for a maximum of (Charisma + Magic) x net hits minutes, but viewers who are attacked, overtly threatened, or otherwise shocked out of it (an appropriately loud noise, sprinkler system or flash-pak going off, unsilenced gunshots, etc.) are snapped out of it early. Enthralling Performance defaults to Con/Performance specialty, but gamemasters may allow Influence/Leadership for a rousing speech, Athletics/ Gymnastics for an impressive display, or even Close Combat/Unarmed for a kata routine, Stealth/Palming for distracting magic tricks, or other combinations as appropriate for the character, decided when it is purchased. It may be purchased more than one time for different Skill/Specialization combinations.
adeptpower.freefall.desc=Some adepts are light on their feet, preternaturally so. Every level of Freefall adds 3 meters to the distance an adept falls before calculating damage (see p. 113, SR6).
adeptpower.great_leap.desc=Great Leap lets an adept cross impressive distances with jumping. When attempting a Jumping test (Athletics + Strength) after investing a Minor Action to focus, an adept with Great Leap can make a running jump of 2 meters per hit, a standing horizontal jump of 1 meter per hit, and a standing vertical jump of 0.5 meters per hit. They also get +1 die on the Jumping test per level of Great Leap.
adeptpower.improved_ability_combat.desc=A skill must be selected when this power is chosen. That skill receives an ongoing boost equal to the rating of the power. The maximum boosted value of the skill is 1.5 times the original (rounded up) or the augmented maximum, whichever is lower. You need to have at least one rank in a skill to buy this power for it, and the power can be purchased for multiple skills.
adeptpower.improved_mental_attribute.desc=Select a Mental attribute (Intuition, Logic, Charisma, or Willpower) when purchasing this power. That attribute receives an ongoing increase equal to the level of this power, up to the augmented maximum of +4 or 1.5 times the current level of the attribute.
adeptpower.improved_physical_attribute.desc=Select a Physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reaction, or Strength) when purchasing this skill. That attribute receives an ongoing boost equal to the level of this power. The maximum boost to the attribute is 1.5 times the current level or the augmented maximum, whichever is lower.
adeptpower.improved_reflexes.desc=This power gives you quick reflexes and anticipation, allowing you to act and react much faster than the normies. For each level of this power, add an Initiative Die and increase your Reaction by 1. The maximum level of this power is 4, and it cannot be combined with any other Initiative or Reaction boosts.
adeptpower.improved_sense.desc=When this power is purchased, select a sense (sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell). When making a test involving that sense, you get a bonus Edge, but only if you use it (either alone or in combination with other Edge points) on that test. Edge points from this power cannot be gained more than once when the same sense (noise, sight, flavor, etc.) is involved. This power can be selected more than once, each time for a different sense.
adeptpower.iron_will.desc=The adept is able to shake off supernatural influences easier than most. They may add +1 die per level of Iron Will to any test to resist magical mind control or magical emotional manipulation (including but not limited to Manipulation spells, critter powers, and adept powers). Kinesics Mastery Prerequisite: Kinesics (p. 157, SR6) An adept with Kinesics Mastery is a master of body language, nonverbal communication, and both sensing tension in others and hiding their own. This power provides two benefits: First, it allows two adepts with Kinesics Mastery and line of sight to one another to relay complicated, detailed information to one another without outsiders noticing (essentially holding a full conversation in secret). Second, every level of Kinesics Mastery increases the number of times per encounter that the Kinesics power grants Edge (p. 157, SR6).
adeptpower.killing_hands.desc=Your hands become lethal and magical, useful both in shadowrunning and cheesy pickup lines. When fighting unarmed, you can choose to deal Stun or Physical damage. Killing Hands can be combined with other powers affecting unarmed combat. Attacks made with Killing Hands are considered magical, meaning they bypass protections against normal weapons and can be made against astral beings.
adeptpower.kinesics.desc=Your command of body language and nonverbal communication is, well, magical, and it helps you be incredibly difficult to read. When you are resisting Social tests and tests to read your emotions, judge your intentions, or gauge your truthfulness, you gain an Edge point. Only one such Edge point can be gained per encounter.
adeptpower.linguistics.desc=An adept with Linguistics is able to focus their superhuman perception, memorization, mimicry, and empathic powers in order to learn languages after only a minimal amount of exposure, and without spending Karma. Adepts must be exposed to a new language for a minimum of one hour, at which time they gain the new Language Skill at the basic level (see Language Skills, p. 99, SR6). Linguistics also provides one bonus die to Perception tests to understand a language in which the character is trained (either via this skill or through traditional means).
adeptpower.living_focus.desc=Living Focus lets an adept focus their internalized mana and use it like a battery to sustain a spell cast on them (similar to a sustaining focus). Using this power to maintain a spell removes the burden of sustaining from the spellcaster and requires no roll, but the adept suffers the usual –2 dice pool penalty for sustaining the spell. If the adept falls asleep or unconscious, they can no longer sustain the spell, so the caster must either sustain it themselves (with the dice pool penalty) or drop it. Additional levels of Living Focus allow adepts to sustain additional spells (one spell per rank in Living Focus) or may be invested in defraying the penalty of sustaining a spell (every rank of Living Focus, after the first, invested into a spell may lower the penalty by 1). For example, Living Focus 3 allows an adept to self-sustain one spell for no penalty, three spells for a total penalty of –6, or two spells for a total penalty of –3).
adeptpower.maneuver.desc=An adept with this power can almost run rings around their chosen opponent, thanks to balance and footwork, along with carefully watching opponents’ body language and tells. To use this power, the adept invests a Major Action and rolls Close Combat + Intuition, opposed by their chosen combatant’s Intuition. Net hits on the Maneuver test may then be allocated as bonus dice to either the adept’s next Close Combat test made to attack that opponent or their next Defense test made against that opponent’s attack (these bonus dice may be stacked with other modifiers, such as the Block action). This “pool” of Maneuver dice goes away if they are not used before the end of next combat round. 
adeptpower.missile_mastery.desc=Everyday items become lethal weapons to an adept with Missile Mastery, due to sheer power, uncanny accuracy, or both. With a purpose-built, non-explosive throwing weapon, increase the DV and Attack Rating of the weapon by +1 (grenades don’t do extra explosive damage just because you throw them really hard, but they may be used as improvised weapons; see below). With an improvised throwing weapon—a coin, a bullet, a playing card, an empty magazine, a chopstick, a flash-pak, use your imagination!—the adept can attack for DV 1P or 1S, with an Attack Rating equal to the adept’s Athletics + Strength at Close and Near range, half that (rounded up) at Medium range, up to a maximum 100 meters. (For example, an adept with Strength 5 and Athletics 4 would create an Attack Rating line of 9/9/5*/—/—.) 
adeptpower.missile_parry.desc=Through uncanny reflexes and hand-eye coordination, an adept with Missile Parry has an extra layer of defense against non-explosive thrown and projectile weapons (to be clear, bullets count as explosive due to the way they are propelled). When being attacked in such a way, the adept may use the Block Minor Action (p. 41, SR6), allowing them to add their Close Combat skill to their Defense test, despite not being in melee. If the adept’s net hits on the Block test exceed the base damage of the projectile or throwing weapon, the adept may, at their discretion, catch the weapon instead of batting it out of the air. 
adeptpower.momentum.desc=Some adepts are capable of a level of focused concentration that unaugmented mundanes cannot match. The Momentum power helps them move from success to success, regardless of how long they work at a task; every level of Momentum lets them ignore one level of the –1 dice pool modifier that progressively shrinks their pool when making an Extended test (SR6 p. 36). For example, Momentum 2 would allow an adept to use their full pool for the first, second, and third Intervals of an Extended test, and then roll with only a –1 penalty on the fourth, –2 on the fifth, etc. 
adeptpower.mystic_armor.desc=Mana forms a shield around you, enhancing your protection. Gain 1 point of Armor for each level of this power, cumulative with worn Armor, which also increases your Defense Rating. Mystic Armor is also active on the astral plane.
adeptpower.nerve_strike.desc=An adept with Nerve Strike is not only in tune with their own flow of internal mana, but also able to disrupt that flow of life energy in others by striking nerve clusters and other focal points where such mana pools. The adept declares the use of this power prior to making a Close Combat roll, then rolls (and the target defends) as normal. Instead of declaring damage after the attack and defense tests, the adept can lower the target’s Agility or Reaction (adept’s choice) by 1 per net hit. If the targeted attribute is reduced to a 0 or less, the target is paralyzed. Lost attribute points recover at the rate of 1 point per hour of rest. No Physical or Stun damage is done by the attack, regardless of any secondary effects that would normally occur (such as striking with a stun baton or making an unarmed attack with Elemental Strike empowered). This power may be used against critters as well as metahumans but is useless against opponents without working nervous systems or biological life energy (drones, spirits, and the like). 
adeptpower.nimble_fingers.desc=Adepts with Nimble Fingers are amazingly dexterous and quick-fingered. The first level of Nimble Fingers lowers the cost of Edge Boosts by one on tests like Stealth (Palming) for sleight-of-hand or picking pockets, Engineering (Lockpicking) for opening locks, or Con (Performance) tests for certain fine manipulations. Each level of Nimble Fingers after the first one grants a +1 dice pool modifier for such tests and a bonus Minor Action that can only be used to offset the Major/Minor Action cost of Pick Up/Put Down Object, Reload Weapon, Use Simple Device, and other actions that rely on quick fingers and manual dexterity (Nimble Fingers 3, for instance, would reduce the Reload Weapon Major Action to an action cost of two Minor Actions, cutting the time it takes in half). This action discount does not apply for Ready Weapon actions; for that, see Quick Draw (below). 
adeptpower.pain_relief.desc=By manipulating someone’s nerve clusters, qi points, and other natural areas where mana and life energy pool within a metahuman body, an adept with Pain Relief may temporarily relieve tension, fatigue, and discomfort. The adept rolls Agility + Magic to accurately target the appropriate points on the body in a flurry of nerve strikes, and for every hit rolled, the target may ignore one point of Stun Damage for purposes of calculating wound modifiers. This damage is not healed, but the target feels refreshed and recharged, better able to continue on despite their bruises or exhaustion. This damage relief fades after (Magic) hours. Alternately, instead of ignoring damage, the subject may have the effects of the Nerve Strike power removed. This effect is permanent. 
adeptpower.pain_resistance.desc=Pain hurts, but you gain an elevated ability to ignore it. For each level of this power, the negative modifiers from damage move one box farther down the Condition Monitor—for example, at level 1, you don’t suffer the –1 penalty until 4 boxes are filled on a Condition Monitor, rather than 3. It works for both Stun and Physical Condition Monitors.
adeptpower.penetrating_strike.desc=Some adepts are supernaturally precise, powerful, or both, in melee combat. For each level of Penetrating Strike, increase your Attack Rating with Close Combat attacks by +1. 
adeptpower.power_throw.desc=Adepts with Power Throw are amazingly dangerous with thrown weapons. For every level of Power Throw, add +1 DV or +2 Attack Rating to direct-damage (non-explosive) thrown weapons (choose which bonus when the level of Power Throw is purchased). These bonuses cannot add an Attack Rating where a weapon has no Attack Rating, and cannot more than double the base DV or AR of an attack so modified. This means a throwing knife (2P, 10/9/3/—/—) is capped, regardless of the number of Power Throw points invested, at an attack profile of (4P, 20/18/6/—/—). Only one level of Power Throw can be used in conjunction with the Missile Mastery power (p. 82), meaning bonuses are capped at +1 DV and +2 Attack Rating. 
adeptpower.quick_draw.desc=The Quick Draw power lets an adept use the Quick Draw Minor Action with weapons larger than the usual pistol or small throwing weapon, and use it on those already-allowed small weapons without the need for a specialized holster, augmentation, or quality. 
adeptpower.quick_strike.desc=There is fast, and there is impossibly fast; an adept with Quick Strike is the latter. When initiative is rolled, an adept with Quick Strike rolls as normal, but may then choose to simply act first that round instead of taking their actions in Initiative order. Their Initiative score is not modified, and they receive no additional Minor Actions because of this power. If two adepts with Quick Strike both use this power at the same time, compare their Initiative Rolls for a tiebreaker, with the higher of them going first, the loser of the comparison going second, and then Initiative progressing as normal. 
adeptpower.rapid_healing.desc=The magic that flows through you helps knit your bones and regrow your flesh, making you heal quickly. Add one hit per level on Healing tests performed to heal you.
adeptpower.side_step.desc=Adepts with Side Step are experts at narrowly avoiding incoming attacks with the most precise and efficient movements possible. Every rank in Side Step provides +1 die on tests when they put extra effort into Defense, such as with the Block or Dodge Minor Actions (the bonus is not given on routine Defense tests, only on those augmented through an action expenditure such as those listed). These bonuses stack with the additional dice offered by Block and Dodge, and with Combat Sense or other such modifiers. 
adeptpower.spell_resistance.desc=Spells have a tendency to bounce off you rather than affect you. Gain a point of Edge when targeted by spells.
adeptpower.spell_shroud.desc=An adept with the Spell Shroud power is fuzzy and indistinct against those who seek them out magically. For every level of this power, add +1 die to all tests to oppose Detection spells. 
adeptpower.sustenance.desc=Some adepts are able to overcome the needs of the body, whether it be through discipline, harnessing the manafield of the planet, surviving off sunlight, eating literal garbage, or meditating their hungers and exhaustion away. The Sustenance power lets an adept receive as much sustenance and rest from one good meal a day and three hours of sleep as most metahumans get from three square meals and a solid eight hours. Reduce the adept’s Lifestyle cost by 250 nuyen/month (needing to eat less makes a world of difference to a Squatter, but not to someone who’s making a full meal out of caviar and quail eggs). 
adeptpower.three_dimensional_memory.desc=Three-Dimensional Memory lets an adept memorize an area in detail through firsthand viewing and with a bit of time (a Major Action at minimum). Later, the adept may make a memory test (Logic + Intuition) with their Magic attribute replacing one or another of the mental attributes if they wish. The difficulty of this test varies based on how far back the adept is trying to remember (difficulty 1 for the first day, 2 for a week, 3 for a month, 4 for a year or more). The area memorized is limited by what the adept was actually able to see, so spending more than one Major Action is a good idea; if they didn’t open a closet or inspect the inside of a desk drawer, for instance, they don’t know what was hidden from them.
adeptpower.traceless_walk.desc=You don’t disturb the dust, dirt, snow, water, or anything else under your feet as you move, so there is no evidence of your passing. You don’t trigger tripwires, pressure pads, or other traps based on leg movement. Hearing tests to listen for your passage and Outdoors tests to perceive your tracks cannot gain or spend Edge.
adeptpower.vocal_control.desc=You can control the pitch and modulation of your voice to make it sound the way you want— loud, quiet, resonant, or like some person you want to imitate. Gain Edge when attempting a Con or Influence test that somehow involves your voice. Only one point of Edge may be earned per encounter with this power.
adeptpower.wall_running.desc=Running horizontally is so pedestrian (get it?). Running up a wall is how you show you’re special. When using this power, you can use a Sprint action (see p. 44) to run up a vertical surface. You cannot use this power for two actions in a row; you have to spend at least one turn moving across a horizontal surface before using this power again. So if you run up a wall and don’t find a good foot or handhold, you’ll be falling right back down.
item.adrenaline_pump.desc=This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure test (p. 67); otherwise you can trigger it as a Minor Action. While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers, don’t fall unconscious even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled, you can’t rest, and the adrenaline pump’s rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for (rating x 1D6) combat rounds, and it can’t be switched off early. When time’s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to one half, rounded up, of the number of combat rounds the pump was active (use unaugmented Body to resist the damage). After the effect’s end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires one hour to regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated.
item.alcohol.desc=Vector: Ingestion; \r\nSpeed: 1 minute; \r\nDuration: (8 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour; \r\nPower: 6; \r\nEffect: –1 Reaction, –1 Logic, High Pain Tolerance; (p. 72); \r\nRanging from wine and beer to pure grain alcohol and mixed up in a variety of ways to taste good going down, alcohol is used across the world, though these days it’s usually synthahol, a synthetic alcohol used because fermentation and processing take nuyen.
item.ammo_arrow.desc=Arrows have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.
item.ammo_battery_laser.desc=
item.ammo_cannon.desc=Big rounds for assault cannons. They’re the only thing assault cannons can load, and they can’t be modified with other types.
item.ammo_injection_arrow.desc=The injection arrow or bolt causes its base damage while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least one box of damage after the Damage Resistance test. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t sturdy enough to deliver this heavier projectile.
item.antidote_patch.desc=The antidote patch cancels or negates the Poisoned Status for a broad range of toxins. If a specific toxin or drug is extremely rare, the gamemaster may require a specific Antidote patch just for that substance (see Toxins and Drugs, p. 121).
item.audio_enhancemend.desc=Audio enhancement allows the user to hear a broader spectrum of frequencies, including high and low frequencies outside the normal metahuman audible spectrum. The user also experiences fine discrimination of nuances and can block out distracting background noise. This system gives a +1 dice pool bonus to all aural Perception tests.
item.audio_enhancement_advanced.desc=Audio enhancement allows the user to hear a broader spectrum of frequencies, including high and low frequencies outside the normal metahuman audible spectrum. The user also experiences fine discrimination of nuances and can block out distracting background noise. This system gives a +1 dice pool bonus to all aural Perception tests.
item.autovoice.desc=The concept of a cyber-augmented throat has been around for decades and is present in some highly illegal hardware that allowed for voice modulators to be used to duplicate other people’s voiceprints. Amore musical-aligned (and legal) version has been around since the early ’70s. Known as “AutoVoice,” it led to a brief flurry of cybernetic-voiced artists who, before the addition, couldn’t carry a tune. Used at a normal setting, the AutoVoice controls airflow through the voice box, and the voice box’s own vibrations, to hit and hold notes as needed. With some software tweaks, this can be turned into a more mechanical sound (creating that distinct AutoVoiced sound of a few years back) or used to pitch the user’s voice up or down but still recognizable only as their own. AutoVoice replaces the user’s own limit for singing performances with its rating. Wireless: The AutoVoice allows the user to broadcast to a local audio network without a mic.
item.autovoice_hacked.desc=The concept of a cyber-augmented throat has been around for decades and is present in some highly illegal hardware that allowed for voice modulators to be used to duplicate other people’s voiceprints. Amore musical-aligned (and legal) version has been around since the early ’70s.

With some software tweaks, this can be turned into a more mechanical sound (creating that distinct AutoVoiced sound of a few years back) or used to pitch the user’s voice up or down but still recognizable only as their own. Software hacks to allow more illegal operation now circle the Shadownet. AutoVoice replaces the user’s own limit for singing performances with its rating. Wireless: The AutoVoice allows the user to broadcast to a local audio network without a mic.
item.balance_augmenter.desc=The balance augmenter enhances the inner ear’s natural balance mechanism. You receive one bonus die on all tests involving balance, such as climbing, walking across a narrow platform, landing after a jump, and so on.
item.biomonitor.desc=This small device constantly measures heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. It can also analyze blood, sweat, and skin samples. Used by medical services and patients who need to monitor their own health, biomonitors can be worn as an armband or wristband or integrated into clothing or commlinks. \r\nWireless Bonus: The biomonitor shares information with other wireless devices you designate and can auto-alert DocWagon or another ambulance service if your life signs reach certain thresholds.
item.bliss.desc=Vector: Inhalation, Injection;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour; \r\n Power: 8; \r\n Effect: –1 Reaction, –1 Willpower, High Pain Tolerance (p. 72)\r\n A tranquilizing narcotic, bliss is an opiate synthesized from poppy plants. It takes its name from the sensations its users feel. Players attempting to roleplay a bliss user may want to focus on the escapist angle, using the drug to block out the chaotic or unsatisfying world.
item.bone_density_augmentation_1.desc=The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density increases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical damage. Your unarmed combat damage becomes Physical and your Damage Value and Attack Rating increase per the table below. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.

Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.
item.bone_lacing_aluminum.desc=Your bones are laced with lattice chains of reinforcing aluminum, improving their integrity and tensile strength. Bone lacing comes in three types: plastic, aluminum, and titanium—you can only have one installed at a time. It gives you extra Body when resisting physical damage, changes your unarmed combat damage to Physical, and adds a few useful bonuses, all listed in the Bone Lacing table. Bone lacing is incompatible with other augmentations that add to or alter your bones (such as bone density augmentation). BODY:+2; \r\n DEFENSE:+1; \r\n UNARMED DV:4P; \r\n UNARMED AR: +2; \r\n
item.bone_lacing_plastic.desc=Your bones are laced with lattice chains of reinforcing plastics, improving their integrity and tensile strength.

item.cats_eyes.desc=These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vision, providing low-light vision (p. 72). Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyberware eye replacements, but individual vision enhancements can be purchased.
item.cerebral_booster.desc=The convolutions and gyri of your cerebrum are augmented and amplified with additional nervous tissue, improving overall brain function. Your cerebral booster increases your Logic attribute by its rating.
item.chem_patch.desc=This is a “blank” patch. You can add one dose of a chemical or toxin (p. 121) to it, and then apply it later to a patient (or yourself).
item.control_rig.desc=This implant harnesses the raw data-coordinating and synchronization power of the middle brain for the express purpose of directly manipulating rigged vehicles and drones (and other devices with rigger interface, like turrets). It has a built-in sim module, allowing DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable that functions like a datajack. When you’re jumped in it provides its rating as a dice pool bonus on and reduction in threshold to all tests involving the operation of vehicle, and a bonus point of Edge.
item.cortex_area_bomb.desc=An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs. Area cranial bombs kill the victim (microbomb damage to victim, 18P, resisted with Body), and they also affect a blast area exactly like a fragmentation grenade (p. 263) resisted separately from the initial microbomb damage. The bombs can be remote or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to blast the area and damage the bearer (microbomb).
item.cortex_kink_bomb.desc=An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs. Kink bombs are designed to damage only part of the victim’s head, either rendering specific headware useless or damaging the brain to cause blindness, stuttering, hearing loss, or some other trauma (5P, resisted with Body; status as appropriate). Of course, sometimes when something in your head explodes, things don’t go exactly as planned and the result is a bit … much. The bombs can be remote-or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to destroy specific components (kink).
item.cortex_microbomb.desc=An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs. The microbomb version is just powerful enough to kill the unfortunate bearer (18P, resisted with Body). The bombs can be remote- or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to destroy the entire limb (regular).
item.cram.desc=Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 10 minutes;\r\n Duration: (12 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour;\r\n Power: 8;\r\n Effect: +1 Reaction, +1D6 Initiative Dice;\r\n Cram is an extremely popular stimulant. When this drug wears off, users crash and suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). Cram users appear hyper-alert, almost to the point of paranoia. They react quickly, often without thought, and they’re prone to irrational outbursts. Other common side effects are jitteriness and fidgeting.

item.cyberjack1.desc=D/F: 4/3; Dice Bonus: +1; As the Matrix protocols have become stiffer and stiffer, work has raced forward to keep hackers operating. The latest tool that has advanced quickly from neat to necessary is the cyberjack, which represents one of those times when shadowrunners turned the tables on the corps. Based on corporate research on technomancers, the cyberjack harnesses the immense processing power of the brain to take on Matrix protocols and encryption schemes. It happened rapidly, but it now seems that a decker without a cyberjack is about as effective as one without a cyberdeck. The cyberjack provides a decker’s primary defense against hacking, offering Data Processing and Firewall ratings that cyberdecks no longer possess, and they also function as a standard datajack. Cyberjacks also allow special Matrix Edge Actions (p. 175).

item.cyberskull_synthetic.desc=The skull replaces the bones and muscles of the head, face, and neck. Having a cyberskull means you also have a cyberjaw that can deliver a powerful bite.
item.cybertorso_obvious.desc=The torso replaces the bones and muscles of the body’s core below the neck to the genital region. Obvious torsos remove genitalia and genital function with the exception of excretion. Internal organs are not replaced, but they are all protected in individual compartments.
item.cybertorso_synthetic.desc=The torso replaces the bones and muscles of the body’s core below the neck to the genital region. Synthetic torso design does its best to appear natural in every way. Some recipients choose to avoid the sculpted look and go for a slim, toned appearance; others go for an “average” body type to help them blend in with the masses.
item.damage_compensator.desc=Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun, or a combination of the two) equal to the compensator’s rating before determining your injury modifiers.
item.damage_compensator.desc=Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun, or a combination of the two) equal to the compensator’s rating before determining your injury modifiers.
item.damper.desc=This implant protects the user from sudden increases in sound as well as damaging sound levels. The damper diminishes the Deafened status by 1 level for any instance in which it is inflicted.
item.datajack.desc=A datajack gives you a direct neural interface. It also comes with a retractable spool of micro-cable (a meter long) that lets you directly interface with any electronic device via a universal access cable. Datajacks are equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or saving files. Two datajack users can string a fiberoptic cable between themselves to conduct a private mental communication immune to radio interception or eavesdropping.
item.datalock.desc=This special datajack is popular with couriers, spies, diplomatic aids, and executive liaisons. Effectively, it turns the character in whom it is installed into a walking data safe. The datalock has a Device Rating equal to its own rating, and it protects the data from anyone not authorized to access it (possibly including you). Datalocks are not wireless enabled; they can only be accessed via universal data connector. In fact, the bearer of the implant doesn’t have mental access to the data — they’re only a carrier.
item.deepweed.desc=Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation; \r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour;\r\n Power: 7;\r\n Effects: +1 Willpower, forces Awakened characters to astrally perceive; \r\n Deepweed is a narcotic derived by Caribbean houngans from an Awakened form of kelp. It’s extremely enticing to the Awakened and is sometimes used to dose targets for possession. Deepweed forces any magically active user to astrally perceive, even if the user is an adept without the astral perception ability. Once its effects have worn off, deepweed users suffer a –1 to all dice pools for the same duration as the initial effect. There are dangers inherent in forced astral perception, such as attracting unwanted attention. Role-playing the effects of deepweed may mean portraying someone who seems not completely “present,” since they aren’t.
item.dermal_plating.desc=Hard plastic and ceramic fiber plates are bonded to the user’s skin. The plates are clearly visible, and are even more obvious to the touch, but they can be cosmetically stylized for color and surface texture. Dermal plating gives you a Defense Rating bonus equal to its rating. Dermal plating cannot be combined with other augmentations to the skin that provide a Defense Rating bonus, including orthoskin.
item.disposable_syringe.desc=Made of plastic with a metal needle, syringes are intended for a single use. Syringes can be used to apply Injection-vector toxins. An uncooperative victim might need to be immobilized or at least grappled first.
item.enhanced_articulation.desc=A number of procedures like joint-surface coating, re-lubrication, and tendon and ligament augmentation lead to more fluid muscle and joint action. Enhanced articulation provides you with a +1 Agility and a bonus Edge when trying to move through cramped or confining spaces.
item.fingertip_compartment.desc=This compartment is hidden in the hollowed-out last joint of one finger, with a catch that allows the fingernail to be lifted up as an access panel, or the entire fingertip removed. A fingertip compartment allows the storage of micro-sized items, like a micro-drone, RFID tag, or datachip. Inserting or removing an object takes a Major Action. Items held within are completely concealed, and the compartment itself has a Concealability threshold of 8. One popular trick is to use a fingertip compartment to hold a monofilament whip (p. 249), with the fingertip acting as control weight. Extending a monofilament whip from a fingertip compartment takes a Minor Action, while spooling it back up requires a Major Action. \r\nWireless Bonus: Inserting or removing an item in a fingertip compartment takes a Minor Action, including spooling up a monofilament whip.
item.flare_compensation.desc=An implanted version of the flare compensation enhancement (p. 275).
item.gamma_scopolamine.desc=Vector: Injection;\r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) x 30 minutes, minimum 30 minutes;\r\n Power: 12;\r\n Effect: Dazed status, Immobilized status, truth serum (see description) ;\r\n This particularly nasty agent, derived from nightshade, is a neuromuscular blocking agent that paralyzes its target. It takes effect immediately, causing dizziness, pupil dilation, speech loss, delirium, and paralysis. The full effects last for about an hour. Once the primary effects wear off, the remaining residue in the victim’s system acts as a “truth serum” for another hour. Reduce the target’s Willpower by 3 (to a minimum of 1) for the remainder of the toxin’s duration.
item.glue_solvent.desc=This spray can has enough solvent to dissolve about a square meter of fast-drying aerosol superglue.
item.glue_sprayer.desc=This fast-drying aerosol superglue allows you to quickly glue two rigid surfaces together, and it holds enough for about a square meter of glue (enough to glue an exterior door or picture window shut). The glue takes 1 combat round to harden. The glue has Body and Strength Ratings of 5 for the purpose of trying to force it (a Body + Strength Opposed test).
item.grapple_gun_augment.desc=This gun shoots a grappling hook and attached rope up to sixty meters microwire. The Firearms test threshold to hit your desired target point is (Range in meters/20, rounded up). It comes equipped with an internal winch to retract the grapple or pull up small loads of up to ten kilograms. Micro rope can be fired up to 100 meters and supports a weight of up to 100 kilograms; standard and stealth ropes only reach sixty meters but can support a weight of up to 400 kilos. May be used untrained as a weapon (AR: 1, DV: 1S).
item.hand_razors_augment.desc=Hand razors go under the fingernails or just replace them, all the better for clawing. As with handblades, the retractable model has a Concealability threshold of 8.
item.handblade_augment.desc=Available in regular and retractable models, the handblade is a simple blade built into the hand, placed opposite the thumb so it can be used with a swinging cut.
item.handblade_retractable_augment.desc=Available in regular and retractable models, the handblade is a simple blade built into the hand, placed opposite the thumb so it can be used with a swinging cut. When retracted, it has a Concealability threshold of 8.
item.hardening_augment.desc=Through this process, the skin/limb is hardened to make it more club-like and damaging. When attacking unarmed, the user has a DV of 3P (increase to 4P if Strength is 7 or greater) and a Close Attack Rating of 6.
item.housing.desc=Sensors can be put into devices that have Capacity. Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats). Wall-mounted and handheld sensor housings are also available for your technological perception needs. Not every type of sensor package is capable of holding every sensor. The Sensor Packages table tells you the maximum sensor rating any particular package can hold.
item.image_link.desc=An implanted version of the image link enhancement (p. 275).
item.implanted_heavy_pistol.desc=All forms of pistols increase their Concealability by 2 when they are implanted; larger guns receive no change, as they are still pretty noticeable, even when they’re implanted. All implanted weapons can be readied with the Quick Draw Minor Action. The only modifications or accessories implanted firearms can accept are laser sights and silencers/ sound suppressors.
item.implanted_holdout.desc=All forms of pistols increase their Concealability by 2 when they are implanted; larger guns receive no change, as they are still pretty noticeable, even when they’re implanted. All implanted weapons can be readied with the Quick Draw Minor Action. The only modifications or accessories implanted firearms can accept are laser sights and silencers/ sound suppressors.
item.implanted_light_pistol.desc=All forms of pistols increase their Concealability by 2 when they are implanted; larger guns receive no change, as they are still pretty noticeable, even when they’re implanted. All implanted weapons can be readied with the Quick Draw Minor Action. The only modifications or accessories implanted firearms can accept are laser sights and silencers/ sound suppressors.
item.implanted_machine_pistol.desc=All forms of pistols increase their Concealability by 2 when they are implanted; larger guns receive no change, as they are still pretty noticeable, even when they’re implanted. All implanted weapons can be readied with the Quick Draw Minor Action. The only modifications or accessories implanted firearms can accept are laser sights and silencers/ sound suppressors.
item.implanted_smg.desc=All forms of pistols increase their Concealability by 2 when they are implanted; larger guns receive no change, as they are still pretty noticeable, even when they’re implanted. All implanted weapons can be readied with the Quick Draw Minor Action. The only modifications or accessories implanted firearms can accept are laser sights and silencers/ sound suppressors.
item.internal_air_tank.desc=The internal air tank replaces part of one lung with a pressurized internal air reserve that allows you to hold your breath for up to (rating) hours. This allows extended underwater operations and complete protection from Inhalation-vector toxin attacks as long as you’re holding your breath. Activating or deactivating the tank is a Minor Action. Refilling the air tank with pressurized air through an intake valve (located under your ribcage) takes five minutes, or you can refill it through six hours of normal breathing. \r\nWireless Bonus: You gain an extra Minor Action during any turn when you activate or deactivate the tank. You’re always aware of the tank’s exact air level and purity.
item.iron_hawk_arrow.desc=Iron Hawk arrows are heavier than standard models but contain a small thruster in the shaft that’s ignited by the pressure of the launch. The thruster helps compensate for the weight-to-power issues, allowing the heavier arrow to hit harder and travel farther.
item.jazz.desc=• Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes;\r\n Power: 9;\r\n Effect: +1 Reaction, +2D6 Initiative Dice;\r\n Jazz is a stimulant designed to better the odds for run-of-the-mill law-enforcement officers who run up against augmented street samurai. It’s usually taken from a single-dose inhaler (or “popper”). When jazz wears off, the user crashes and is flooded with despondent and miserable emotions, gaining the Dazed status (p. 52) for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effect. Jazz makes people as jumpy and hyper as caffeinated two-year-olds. Role-playing a jazz user means turning it up a notch, portraying someone with too much energy to burn—and too much energy to focus.
item.kamikaze.desc=Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes;\r\n Power: 10;\r\n Effect: +1 Body, +1 Agility, +2 Strength, +1 Willpower, +2D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance (p. 72);\r\n Kamikaze is a tailored combat stimulant. When kamikaze wears off, the user crashes and suffers –1 Reaction, –1 Willpower, and the Fatigued II status for twice the duration of the drug’s Effect. They also suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted).\r\n The repeated use of kamikaze has a destructive effect on the user’s metabolism. Large doses can cause excitement, tremors, momentary euphoria, and dilated pupils. Excess doses (bordering on overdose level) cause anxiety, hallucinations, and uncontrolled muscular movements. Even higher dosages lead to death. Kamikaze users are nearcrazed, filled with a feeling of imperviousness and invincibility, exhibiting almost no regard for their own well-being. They can be entertaining to watch, as long as you’re not in front of them.
item.liter_milk.desc=The two most common crowd-control weapons you see deployed are Pepper Punch spray and CS/Tear Gas. These are both quite effective at disruption, leaving targets nauseated and blind, easy prey for the follow-up arrests. One of the best responses to this is good ol’ milk. A full liter of milk poured onto one’s eyes will wash away and neutralize the burning sensation and clear out the mucus membranes as an effective, if messy, counter-measure. If you ever wondered why riot professionals always have a jug of milk on their belt, now you know. One liter of milk removes the Nausea status from CS/Tear Gas or Pepper Punch and the Dazed status from CS/Tear Gas with a full action’s application. It has no effect on any suffered Stun damage.
item.long_haul.desc=Vector: Injection;\r\n Speed: 10 minutes;\r\n Duration: 4 days;\r\n Power: 11;\r\n Effect: Alleviates need for sleep;\r\n A combination of synthesized hormones and other brain-regulating chemicals, long haul stimulates the brain and keeps the user awake, obviating the need for sleep. A character dosed on long haul can remain awake for four days — without incurring any modifiers from fatigue or weariness. After this time, however, the user immediately passes out and sleeps soundly for 8D6 hours. If the character is kept awake during this period, they suffer from the Fatigued I status (p. 52), as they are afflicted with hallucinations and an inability to concentrate. If a second dose of long haul is taken after the first has worn off, the character can stay awake an additional (1D6 / 2) days but suffers the Fatigued I status. A third dose offers a single day of wakefulness while dealing with the Fatigued II status. A fourth offers one more day with the Fatigued III status. After that, additional doses will have no effect, and the user suffers 12 Stun damage (unresisted) and must crash as detailed above. Long haul cannot keep a character awake past this point, no matter how many additional doses are administered. If forced awake with a stim patch, the Fatigued III state persists until the 8D6 hours of rest (more like a coma, really) have been taken.
item.low_light_vision.desc=An implanted version of the low-light vision enhancement (p. 275).
item.magical_lodge_materials.desc=Used to create a lodge for shamans or a hermetic circle for hermetics, the gear is sold with a bag that holds all the components. Once used, some items are reusable. To reuse parts, it takes a number of hours equal to the rating of the circle or lodge to break down properly, and purchasing the new missing components cuts the cost in half.
item.medkit.desc=The medkit includes drug supplies, bandages, tools, and a (talkative) doctor expert system that can advise the user on techniques to handle most typical medical emergencies (including fractures, gunshot wounds, chemical wounds, and poisoning, as well as offering advice for the treatment of shock, handling blood loss, and of course performing resuscitations). The medkit counts as Kit for Biotech tests. For rules on using a medkit, see p. 119. \r\nWireless Bonus: The medkit provides a +1 dice pool modifier to healing tests.
item.medkit_supplies.desc=Medkit supplies need to be purchased after each use or extras can be purchased. Up to five sets of supplies can be stored in the medkit’s case; sets beyond that will need to be carried elsewhere.
item.mnemonic_enhancer.desc=This highly concentrated growth of grey matter gets attached to the brain’s memory centers, improving both short- and long-term memory. Add the enhancer’s rating as a dice pool bonus to your Knowledge, Language, and memory-related tests.
item.muscle_augmentation.desc=This biological weaving treatment enhances existing muscle tissue, rather than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are woven into existing muscle fibers, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your Strength attribute. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Strength, including the muscle replacement cyberware.
item.muscle_replacement.desc=Vat-grown synthetic muscles replace or augment your own, and calcium treatments and skeletal reinforcement contribute to your overall strength. It increases both your Strength and Agility attributes by its rating. It cannot be combined with other augmentations to the muscles, including muscle augmentation or muscle toner bioware.
item.muscle_toner.desc=This treatment increases muscle-fiber elasticity in existing muscle tension, resulting in increased muscle tension and flexibility while providing a smooth and ropy physique. Muscle toner adds its rating to your Agility attribute. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Agility, including the muscle replacement cyberware and enhanced articulation bioware.
item.narcoject.desc=Vector: Injection;\r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour;\r\n Power: 15;\r\n Effect: Stun Damage;\r\nA common tranquilizer, narcoject is typically used with dart guns. It has no side effects.
item.nausea_gas.desc=Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 3 combat rounds;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) minutes, minimum 1 minute;\r\n Power: 9;\r\n Effect: Dazed status, Nauseated status;\r\n Used as a riot control agent, this gas causes nausea and a crippling need to vomit. Nausea gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.
item.neuro_stun_ix.desc=Vector: Contact, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) x 10 minutes, minimum 10 minutes;\r\nPower: 12;\r\n Effect: Dazed status, Stun Damage;\r\n Neuro-Stun is colorless and odorless. It’s the industry standard knockout gas for emergency containment situations and comes in various concentrations. Neuro-Stun IX  become completely inert after one minute.
item.neuro_stun_viii.desc=Vector: Contact, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) x 10 minutes, minimum 10 minutes;\r\nPower: 9;\r\n Effect: Dazed status, Stun Damage;\r\n Neuro-Stun is colorless and odorless. It’s the industry standard knockout gas for emergency containment situations and comes in various concentrations. Neuro-Stun VIII becomes completely inert after ten minutes of contact with air; Neuro-Stun IX and X become completely inert after one minute.
item.neuro_stun_x.desc=Vector: Contact, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) x 10 minutes, minimum 10 minutes;\r\nPower: 15;\r\n Effect: Dazed status, Stun Damage;\r\n Neuro-Stun is colorless and odorless. It’s the industry standard knockout gas for emergency containment situations and comes in various concentrations. Neuro-Stun X become completely inert after one minute.
item.nitro.desc=Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes;\r\n Power: 12;\r\n Effect: +2 Strength, +2 Willpower, +2 Perception, +1D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance(p. 72);\r\n A dangerous combination of potent drugs favored by troll gangers, nitro is a powerful stimulant that can easily kill a user. After the drug’s effects wear off, the subject takes 9 Stun damage (unresisted) and suffers –2 to all tests (including Damage Resistance) for an equal duration. Nitro users feel infused with energy, suffer a diminished attention span, and talk incessantly (including to themselves).
item.novacoke.desc=Vector: Inhalation, Injection; Speed: 1 combat round\r\n; Duration: (10 – Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour; \r\n Power: 12;\r\n • Effect: +1 Reaction, +1 Charisma, +1 Perception, High Pain Tolerance (p. 72);\r\n A stimulant derived from coca plants, novacoke is a highly addictive social drug. After the drug wears off, Charisma and Willpower are both reduced to 0 for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effect.
item.ocular_drone.desc=This enhancement only affects one eyeball per purchase. A small drone (treat it as a Horizon Flying Eye, p. 299) is placed in your ocular cavity. The spyball functions as a normal cybereye (with all the relevant enhancements) until you remove it and control it as though it were a drone. When it’s out, you have only one eye and suffer the Blindness I Status effect for all tasks. If you replace both eyes with drones, you gain the Blindness III Status Effect while those drones are operating apart from you. An ocular drone is obviously a fake eye.
item.olfactory_booster.desc=This cybersnout enhances, identifies, and records smells, and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a whole new world of sensory data to you—you’ll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scenthound would. You can smell people’s emotions in their sweat (and if applicable, the maker’s mark of their tailored pheromones), traces of ammunition propellant, explosives, or biological and chemical warfare compounds—the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odors, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. The olfactory booster can even be used in VR to create an even more immersive experience. The user gains a bonus Edge for all scent-based Perception tests, but it goes away if they do not use it on that test.
item.orthoskin.desc=A web of biofibers in the skin provides the equivalent of personal armor while being virtually indistinguishable from natural skin. Orthoskin provides a bonus equal to its rating to your Defense Rating. Orthoskin cannot be combined with skin augmentations, including dermal plating.
item.pain_editor.desc=This cluster of specialized nervous tissue is designed to filter sensory stimuli. If the pain editor is active, this allows you to ignore all injury modifiers, and you even stay conscious when your Stun Condition Monitor is completely full. You feel no pain—you’re blissfully, dangerously, recklessly unaware of the extent of damage you’ve taken without either performing a self-examination (Observe in Detail action) or being informed by a biomonitor (p. 281). While active, the pain editor increases your Willpower by 1 and decreases your Intuition by 1; additionally, all tactile Perception tests you make have their threshold increased by 1.
item.pepper-punch.desc=Vector: Contact, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (8 – Body) x 20 minutes, minimum 20 minutes;\r\n Power: 11;\r\n Effect: Blinded I status, Dazed status, Nauseated status, Stun Damage;\r\nPepper punch is an irritant combining CS and capsaicin, which is derived from the active ingredient in hot peppers, along with other chemicals. It is typically deployed as a liquid spray for personal defense and deterrence; this agent is often tagged with RFID tags or special dyes to identify victims later. Someone dosed with pepper punch feels an intense burning on any affected skin; this affect is even more pronounced if it gets in the eyes, nose, or mouth. Victims sprayed in the eyes have trouble seeing, and breathing becomes difficult.
item.platelet_factories.desc=Platelet factories increase your body’s ability to handle Physical damage by accelerating the production of platelets and their concentration in the blood, which helps stop bleeding faster. Any time you would take 2 or more boxes of damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, reduce the damage by 1 box.
item.psyche.desc=Vector: Ingestion;\r\n Speed: 10 minutes;\r\n Duration: (12—Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour;\r\n Power: 8;\r\n • Effect: +1 Intuition, +1 Logic;\r\n This designer stimulant is especially prized by magicians and technomancers alike. In addition to the effects noted above, Awakened and Emerged users also only suffer a –1 dice pool modifier for each sustained spell or complex form (rather than the standard –2). Psyche users are simultaneously hyper-aware and detached, easily absorbed by detail and obsessive about certain facts or problems.
item.reaction_enhancers.desc=By replacing specific, isolated vertebrae of your spinal column with segments of superconducting material, your reactions to events become quicker. Add the rating of reaction enhancers to your Reaction attribute (and remember to adjust your Initiative Score accordingly). Reaction enhancers are incompatible with all other enhancements to Reaction, including wired reflexes. \r\nWireless Bonus: Reaction enhancers are compatible with a wireless wired reflexes system.
item.reagents_per_dram.desc=These powders are used to mitigate some of the difficulties inherent in using magic in the Sixth World. They are sold by the dram and lose potency after use.
item.reflex_recorder.desc=This system uses extra nervous tissue linked to specific areas of the body to improve muscle memory. The reflex recorder adds 1 to the rating of a skill linked to a Physical attribute. Multiple recorders may be taken for multiple skills, but you can’t implant two reflex recorders for the same skill.
item.retinal_duplication.desc=This highly illegal modification can be loaded with a recording of someone else’s retina to create an almost perfect reproduction. Make an Opposed test between the retinal duplication rating and the retinal scanner rating (Sensors and Scanners, p. 241). The system can actively store a number of retinas equal to its rating. Changing retinal patterns requires 1 minute.
item.select_sound_filter.desc=This system blocks out background noise and can focus on specific sounds or patterns of sounds. It even includes speech, word, and sound pattern recognition. The system can load a number of select sounds up to its rating (such as the footsteps of a patrolling guard, a particular word, or the rotors of a distant helicopter). You only actively listen to one group at a time, but you can record the others for later playback or set them to trigger an alert if they are activated. The system can have a rating of 1 to 3.
item.sensor_array.desc=This sensor package includes up to its rating in functions from the Sensor Functions options. Each option is purchased separately when purchasing the array. Sensor arrays have a rating from 2 to 8.
item.seven_7.desc=Vector: Contact, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) x 10 minutes, minimum 10 minutes;\r\n Power: 12;\r\n Effect: Blinded I status, Physical Damage, Dazed status, Nauseated status;\r\nThis is another colorless and odorless gas, developed specifically to bypass chemical protection measures. In addition to Physical damage, Seven-7 causes cramping, nausea, and double vision in victims. Seven-7 oxidizes and becomes inert after ten minutes of exposure to air.
item.shock_limb_augment.desc=This limb has electrodes built in at strategic points that can deliver a taser-like jolt to targets. Hands are customarily used, but some fighters have grown fond of the shock kick, and stories proliferate of fighters engaging in street head butts.
item.simrig.desc=An implanted version of the simrig described on p. 268, this headware implant allows you to record sensory data for later replay (or sale if you live a really interesting life).
item.single_sensor.desc=This is a sensor that can do only one function listed under Sensor Functions (p. 277). Sensors have a rating from 1 to 8.
item.skilljack.desc=This headware interprets knowsofts and linguasofts for your brain so you can use them as though they were your own. It can also run activesofts, but they only act as Knowledge Skills unless you have skillwires (p. 287). The total of all skills running on a skilljack cannot exceed its rating x 2, and the maximum rating for a single skill is the skilljack’s rating. Starting skills from storage and stopping skills doesn’t require an action. You can’t use Edge with skills you have through a skilljack.
item.skillwires.desc=Skillwires are a system of neuromuscular controllers that overlay the body’s natural nervous system; they are capable of aiding or completely overriding muscular movement, controlled by the muscle memory played through a skilljack (p. 284). This system allows you to use activesofts with a rating up to your skillwire’s rating, but only if that activesoft is running on your implanted skilljack. \r\nWireless Bonus: With the skillwire’s memory cache expanded, all the skills you use with it receive a +1 dice pool modifier.
item.skin_pocket.desc=This skin flap can be located anywhere on your body. A nerveless sheath of flesh concealed by the flap is perfect for hiding a small object—it’s a bioware version of a smuggling compartment (p. 287). The skin pocket has a Concealability threshold of 10. It takes a Major Action to add or remove an item from a skin pocket.
item.sleep_regulator.desc=The sleep regulator is a modification to the hypothalamus, allowing for longer periods of wakefulness, an incredibly useful advantage for anyone with any profession, not just shadowrunners. You need less sleep per day, and the sleep you get is deep and restful (and harder to wake you up from). The sleep regulator lets you get by with three hours of sleep each night, and you can stay awake for twice as long as normal without acquiring the Fatigued status (p. 52). Resting hours for healing purposes are not affected.
item.smartlink.desc=An implanted version of the smartlink vision enhancement (p. 275). This is the vision accessory side of the smartgun system (p. 260). The smartlink receives the range to various targets, ammunition level (and type), and offers a targeting dot wherever the gun is pointed if within the visual field of the user.
item.smuggling_compartment.desc=For items that won’t fit in a fingertip but you still can’t afford to have found, smuggling compartments can be placed in parts of the body that can be easily hollowed out/replaced. This includes ribs and the space between them, hip bones, shoulder blades, and so forth. These compartments allow the storage of small and miniature items (nothing bigger than a light pistol typically; your gamemaster will let you know if something’s too big). The compartment has a Concealability threshold of 8. Inserting or retrieving an object requires a Major Action. \r\nWireless Bonus: Inserting or retrieving an object takes a Minor Action.
item.soundlink.desc=The audio equivalent of image link, sound link can play audio (recordings, movie soundtracks, music, etc.) from linked sources within the user’s PAN (or headware memory, or datajack) directly into the user’s cyberears. A sound link is a common component of immersive AR environments, adding a sonic component.
item.spatial_recognizer.desc=This hearing accessory pinpoints the source of a sound. You get a bonus Edge on your Perception tests to find the source of a specific sound, but if you do not spend the Edge immediately, it goes away. \r\nWireless Bonus: You get a +1 dice pool modifier to your audio Perception Tests when looking for a sound’s source. This can be combined with other dice pool modifiers.
item.spurs_augment.desc=These are spikes placed on the wrist or the back of knuckles, designed to give a stabbing puncture to a punch or slap.
item.spurs_retractable_augment.desc=These are spikes placed on the wrist or the back of knuckles, designed to give a stabbing puncture to a punch or slap. The retractable model has a Concealability threshold of 8.
item.stim_patch.desc=This patch removes a number of boxes of Stun damage equal to its rating and cancels the Dazed Status Effect. The effect lasts for (rating x 10) minutes— after that period of time, the patient takes (rating + 1) unresisted Stun damage (which may well become Overflow by that point). While a stimulant patch is in effect, the character is unable to rest.
item.suprathyroid_gland.desc=Placed on top of your existing thyroid gland, the suprathyroid gland supersedes the metabolic functions of your thyroid. The enhanced metabolism produces more energy, supercharging you. In order to fuel your optimized metabolism, you’ll need to eat twice as much as normal. You get a +1 to your Agility, Body, Reaction, and Strength, along with a 25 percent boost in Lifestyle costs.
item.symbiote_food.desc=Symbiotes have unusual dietary requirements that must be met to keep them alive. You need to pay (Rating x 200) nuyen per month for special symbiote food, although if you have a High Lifestyle or better, it’s covered. If they are not fed, they die in a month.
item.symbiotes.desc=Tailored micro-organisms in your bloodstream greatly enhance your healing. Add the rating of the symbiotes as a dice pool modifier on healing tests (Physical and Stun). However, the symbiotes have unusual dietary requirements that must be met to keep them alive. You need to pay (Rating x 200) nuyen per month for special symbiote food, although if you have a High Lifestyle or better, it’s covered. If they are not fed, they die in a month.
item.synaptic_booster.desc=The nerve cells making up the spinal cord are both broadened and replicated with this bioware, allowing for more neural bandwidth. The result is a much faster reaction time. The booster confers a bonus of +1 Reaction (with accompanying bonus to your Initiative Score) and 1 additional Initiative Die (with accompanying Minor Action). The synaptic booster cannot be combined with any other form of Reaction or Initiative enhancement. Unlike other enhancements, this cannot be turned off, leaving the user in a perpetual state of being surrounded by slow motion.
item.synthacardium.desc=Artificially enhanced myocardium allows cardiovascular functions to be performed more efficiently, enabling the heart to keep the blood better oxygenated. The synthacardium adds its rating as a dice pool bonus to your Athletics skill tests for running, swimming, and climbing.
item.tailored_pheremones.desc=These pheromones are specially tailored to subtly influence others and can be released at will. Tailored pheromones increase your Charisma attribute by their Rating for Con and Influence tests, but only when the person you’re using them on is within a comfortable conversation range—if they can’t smell you, the pheromones don’t work. Tailored pheromones have no effect on magical abilities and tests.
item.taste_booster.desc=The taste booster performs the same function as the olfactory booster, except that it enhances your taste buds. The taste booster also lets you experience gustatory data in AR and VR environments with a “taste track”—caveat emptor on that one, chummer. The user gains a bonus Edge for all taste-based Perception tests, but it goes away if they do not use it on that test.
item.tear_gas.desc=Vector: Contact, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) x 5 minutes, minimum 5 minutes;\r\n Power: 8;\r\n• Effect: Dazed status, Nauseated status, Stun Damage;\r\nCS gas is an irritant that affects the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth, and lungs. The real danger is when the gas is inhaled, stimulating a physiological panic response: increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and so forth. CS gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.
item.thermit_burning_bar.desc=Thermite is an incendiary material that burns at extremely high temperatures. It is applied with the help of a burning bar—a rod of thermite and oxygen mounted on a handle and in a frame—that can be used to melt holes in iron, steel, and even plasteel. The thermite burning bar inflicts Fire Damage with a DV of 10P. It has to be set carefully, so a thermite bar can’t be used as a weapon, unless your target is incapacitated somehow, you cruel fragger. \r\nWireless bonus: The burning bar can be activated and deactivated wirelessly.
item.thermographic_vision.desc=An implanted version of the thermographic vision enhancement (p. 275). This enhancement enables vision in the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately, and so on. This modification offers a bonus Edge if the opposition doesn’t have a vision enhancement to mitigate limited light and even total darkness.
item.tooth_compartment.desc=The oldest cyberware on the market, these hollow teeth come in storage and breakable models. The storage model is used to smuggle really, really tiny contraband, no larger than five millimeters on a side. Items can be removed with a wireless signal or hidden catch. The breakable model triggers a linked effect (such as starting a tracking signal or releasing deadly poison into your mouth—make sure you remember which is which!) with a wireless signal, or it may trigger when you bite down hard on the tooth.
item.toxin_etractor.desc=A specially cultivated cluster of cells in your liver improves its filtering capabilities. The toxin extractor subtracts its rating from the threshold of Toxin Resistance tests (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121).
item.tracheal_filter.desc=Implanted at the top of your trachea, this organ can absorb airborne impurities and keep them from reaching your lungs. The filter adds its rating as a dice pool bonus to Toxin Resistance tests versus Inhalation-vector toxins (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121).
item.tranq_patch.desc=This patch inflicts Stun damage equal to its rating, resisted with only Body.
item.trauma_patch.desc=When applied, the patient heals 1d6 + 1 Overflow Damage immediately. These patches are always wireless and connect to the Matrix the moment they are applied.
item.ultrasound_sensor.desc=This cyberware is exactly like the ultrasound sensor. When active, it replaces your normal vision. It can be switched between active sonar, passive sonar, and off with a Minor Action.

item.vocal_expansion.desc=A terrifying upgrade usually undertaken only by those who’ve suffered throat damage but sometimes gambled on by those who need the extra edge to break in, vocal expansion is a series of minor bioware improvements to the throat and lungs, controlling the flow of air through the voice box, strengthening the user’s natural abilities to create longer, clearer notes, a more powerful sound, and a throat more resistant to hoarseness and strain. If it goes wrong, it can ruin someone’s career forever or, in a worst-case scenario, render them mute. Currently the upgrade is reserved to beta or delta clinics, but once perfected, it should filter down to standard clinics in a few years. A vocal expansion raises the user’s natural limit for Leadership tests using Influence and Performance (singing) tests using Con by its rating.
item.voice_modulator.desc=This implant gives you perfect pitch and enormous vocal flexibility and distortion capabilities. You can speak with an increased volume (up to one hundred decibels) without strain, shift your pitch to make perfect bird calls or mellifluous singing, and most importantly, uncanny vocal impressions.

martialart.52blocks.desc=Known by a wide variety of other names, 52 Blocks evolved from fighting styles practiced by African American slaves and was further developed by inmates in American prison systems throughout the twentieth century. The style is highly defensive and mobile, highlighted by the “52 blocks” that give it its name, while also incorporating striking and knife techniques. Signature Technique: Elbows In;
martialart.aikido.desc=Widely known as the “pacifist’s martial art,” aikido is a “soft” martial art that relies on using the opponent’s force against them. The techniques are almost purely defensive, emphasizing disarming and restraining attackers without inflicting harm. Aikido also possesses a strong spiritual element, combining traditional Buddhist and Shinto beliefs with a philosophy of peace and non-violence. Signature Technique: Sacrifice Throw;
martialart.arnis.desc=An umbrella term for a collection of Filipino martial arts, arnis (also known as arnis de mano, escrima, or kali) emphasizes the use of paired rattan sticks (baston) or daggers (baraw/daga), as well as longer blunt and bladed weapons, unarmed strikes, and joint locks. Similar Styles: Banshay (Myanmar), gatka/shastar vidya (India), krabi-krabong (Thailand), Nguni stick fighting (Azania) Signature Technique: Two-Weapon Fighting;
martialart.bartitsu.desc=Known as the “gentleman’s martial art” and made famous by literary heroes like Sherlock Holmes and John Steed, bartitsu teaches the use of a cane or umbrella—back in the day, those were objects people might carry on an everyday basis— as a self-defense tool. Signature Technique: Parry;
martialart.boxing.desc=Ah, good ol’ fisticuffs. Boxing is the ancient art of punching someone until they fall over, hopefully before they punch you until you fall over. The styles of individual boxers vary greatly—some are highly mobile and throw flurries of punches, while others focus on taking punishment until they can knock their opponent out in a single blow. The chief difference is that unlike other styles of unarmed combat, boxing relies on fists alone. Signature Technique: Mean Right Hook;
martialart.capoeira.desc=Developed in Amazonia (then known as Brazil) by slaves of African heritage, capoeira has practitioners who avoid detection by disguising their art as a dance. Since the practitioners’ hands were often shackled, preventing them from attacking or defending effectively with their arms, capoeira emphasizes highly evasive movements and leg techniques like kicks and sweeping the legs. Similar Styles: Engolo (Angola); Signature Technique: Feint;
martialart.careomeleg.desc=The much-celebrated elven martial art relies on quick, accurate strikes (both unarmed and with various bladed weapons) and highly mobile defenses, often leading to the claim that there are “no stances” in carromeleg. Claims that the style was actually developed in a previous age of the world continue to swirl, and traditionally minded carromeleg instructors will only accept elves as students— but a handful of carromeleg masters have begun sharing their style with non-elves, leading to a great deal of friction within the carromeleg community (such as it is). Techniques: Bending of the Reed (Melee);
martialart.chakram_fighting.desc=The chakram is originally a throwing weapon from the Indian subcontinent, though it was widely used across various parts of Asia. It typically takes the form of a sharpened ring that can be worn as jewelry until it was needed in combat. The chakram can also be worn as a sharpened knuckle-duster, provided the user is willing to risk cutting their own hand. Similar Styles: Shurikenjutsu (Japan);Signature Technique: Pin;
martialart.close_quarters_combat.desc=“Combatives” is a general description for practically focused, “tactical” martial arts developed for use by law enforcement and military personnel, rather than traditional styles carried into the present day. They often include a mix of grappling and striking techniques, including baton techniques, disarming opponents with weapons, and methods of using firearms in hand-to-hand combat. Similar Styles: Krav Maga, MCMAP, Systema; Signature Technique: Releasing Talons;
martialart.european_fencing_longsword.desc=One of many weapons flying the banner of “historical European martial arts,” the longsword is the archetypal two-handed sword used throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. Its resurgence in the Sixth World came about thanks to the re-discovery of manuals by masters like Fiore dei Liberi and Johannes Lichentauer, which gained special traction among street samurai who disdain the katana as being over-hyped. Originally developed for the battlefield, longsword fencing is perfect for those who intend to cut through swathes of opponents in a single swing. Signature Technique: Half-Sword;
martialart.european_fencing_rapier.desc=This is not modern sport fencing, but rather combat in the style of Bonetti, Capo Ferro, Thibault, Agrippa, and that one classic flatvid duel from the 1980s. Most twenty-first-century fencing is based on techniques that originated in France and Italy, although the Spanish style of la verdadera destreza has gained quite a bit of traction in recent years. European duelists often paired their rapiers with an off-hand weapon like a dagger, a tradition that’s survived into the modern day. Signature Technique: Ballestra;
martialart.gun_kata.desc=More of a performance art than a combat art in its twentieth-century flatvid incarnations, Gun Kata (also known as Gun Fu) has taken on a new practicality in an era of supernaturally and technologically enhanced reflexes and aim. The style focuses on the use of the pistol as both a melee and ranged weapon, and many Gun Kata practitioners modify their guns to increase their sturdiness in melee (and disable the annoying warnings from their smartlinks about improper shooting posture). Gun Kata retains some of the flashiness of its showbiz origins, and Gun Kata stylists have been known to incorporate both acrobatics and trick shots into their fighting style. Signature Technique: Close-Quarters Firearms (Handguns);
martialart.hapsum_do.desc=Though adepts practice a wide variety of martial arts styles with fearsome effectiveness, hapsum-do (or the Way of Unified Mana) is the first martial arts style developed specifically to make use of an adept’s supernatural powers. Grandmaster “Barghest” Knorr, an adept who travels around the world to share his techniques, is widely acknowledged as the founder of the style. Functionally similar to other “hybrid” arts that include both grappling and striking techniques (and thus usable by non-adepts in many respects), certain hapsum-do techniques rely on the practitioners’ Awakened abilities to be effective. Signature Technique: Meridian Strike;
martialart.jeet_kune_do.desc=The style of Jeet Kune Do was first developed by the legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, combining elements of many existing martial arts styles under a philosophy of “whatever works”—the same philosophy applied by practitioners of mixed martial arts, who often study both grappling and striking styles (jujutsu and Muay Thai is a popular combination) to ensure their effectiveness in the ring. Similar Styles: Hapkido (Korea); Signature Technique: Sweep the Leg;
martialart.jogo_do_pao.desc=Developed in Portugal, Jogo do Pao is effectively staff fighting. It evolved from the techniques that residents of rural areas used to fend off dangerous wildlife with long walking sticks.

Similar Styles: Ball de bastons (Iberian peninsula),canne de combat (France); Signature Technique: Threatening Edge;
martialart.jujutsu.desc=Jujutsu (and its combat-sport variant, judo) is an unarmed combat style from Japan that focuses heavily on grappling, restraining/subduing, and throwing techniques. It’s frequently studied by police officers for the purposes of disarming and arresting suspects, and by bouncers for escorting unruly customers off the premises. Similar Styles: Malla-yuddha (India), sambo (Russia), shuai jiao (China); Signature Technique: Joint Lock;
martialart.karate.desc=One of the first Asian martial arts introduced to the Western world, karate originates from Okinawa and focuses primarily on striking, with particular emphasis on the fists and other parts of the hand (“karate” translates as “empty hand”). Kicking techniques are relatively common in karate, while grappling and weapon use is more rare. Similar Styles: Tang Soo Do (Korea); Signature Technique: Tameshiwari;
martialart.kenjutsu.desc=A term well-known to both street samurai and anyone within earshot of a Japanese culture enthusiast, kenjutsu is the art of fighting with the Japanese sword. It’s strongly associated with the katana, but most kenjutsu styles also include techniques for using the kodachi/wakizashi (short swords) and tanto (dagger), as well as the related art of battojutsu/iaijutsu (the art of drawing the sword and attacking in the same motion). The sport form, kendo, is widely popular in Japan. Similar Styles: Geom beop (Korea); Signature Technique: Iaijutsu;
martialart.kickboxing.desc=As one might guess from the name, kickboxing is boxing with the addition of feet—and often elbows, knees, and other body parts, including the head. Much like its hands-only cousin, kickboxing relies almost exclusively on striking, with relatively little in the way of grappling or weapons techniques (though many kickboxing styles have companion arts focusing on the use of weapons). Similar Styles: Lethwei (Myanmar), Muay Boran/Muay Thai (Thailand), Muay Lao (Laos), Musti-yuddha (India), Pradal Serey (Cambodia), sanshou (China);Signature Technique: Ti Khao;
martialart.knight_errant_tactical.desc=These two combat systems, developed by the law-enforcement corps whose names they bear, are essentially Sixth World spins on the CQC combatives of the twentieth century. Practitioners of either style would swear that their approach was completely different than the other guys. At the end of the day, though, both Knight Errant and Lone Star deal with basically the same situations in the course of their duties, and each corp’s approach to dealing with those situations is fundamentally similar. The primary difference between the two styles is that Knight Errant places more emphasis on disarming individual attackers (you never know when they might be a SINner who can file a complaint and cause a PR headache), while Lone Star focuses on crowd control. Signature Techniques: Multiple Opponent; Combat (Lone Star Tactical)/Releasing Talons(Knight Errant Tactical);
martialart.kung_fu.desc=More properly a group of related martial arts styles, the term “kung fu” usually applies to the “external” or “hard” styles characterized by dynamic, physically strenuous techniques with a heavy emphasis on striking. Popular examples of kung fu styles include the Five Animals style, the Shaolin styles, Wing Chun, and wushu. Similar Styles: Silat/pencak silat (Indonesia), silat Melayu (Malaysia), Shorinji kempo (Japan); Signature Technique: Drunken Boxing;
martialart.kung_fu_18.desc=Historically, many styles of martial arts integrated the study of weapons into the same curriculum as unarmed techniques. In China, the four main martial arts weapons were the spear (qiang), staff (gun), saber (dao), and straight sword (jian), along with more exotic weapons like the halberd, three-section staff, and rope dart. Similar Styles: Bojutsu (Japan), kobudo (Okinawa), quarterstaff fighting; Signature Technique: Tricking;
martialart.kyujutsu.desc=Kyujutsu is a Japanese form of archery using an unusually long bow called a yumi, the largest of which were sometimes taller than their wielders. Originally practiced by the samurai, kyujutsu fell out of mainstream use with the introduction of firearms, but it has regained popularity in the Sixth World for both cultural and practical reasons. Similar Styles: Turkish archery (Turkey); Signature Technique: Pin;
martialart.lone_star_tactical.desc=These two combat systems, developed by the law-enforcement corps whose names they bear, are essentially Sixth World spins on the CQC combatives of the twentieth century. Practitioners of either style would swear that their approach was completely different than the other guys. At the end of the day, though, both Knight Errant and Lone Star deal with basically the same situations in the course of their duties, and each corp’s approach to dealing with those situations is fundamentally similar. The primary difference between the two styles is that Knight Errant places more emphasis on disarming individual attackers (you never know when they might be a SINner who can file a complaint and cause a PR headache), while Lone Star focuses on crowd control. Signature Techniques: Multiple Opponent; Combat (Lone Star Tactical)/Releasing Talons(Knight Errant Tactical);
martialart.ninjutsu.desc=Though widely known in popular culture as assassins, ninja were historically infiltrators and spies. In contrast to the samurai (and much like shadowrunners), ninjas were willing to employ any number of “dishonorable” techniques to win battles and achieve their objectives. Stealth and quickly disabling opponents were key tenets of ninjutsu (sometimes known as taijutsu). Ninja combat arts also included many weapons techniques, most notably the use of the shuriken. Signature Technique: Dim Mak;
martialart.okichitaw.desc=Originating with the Plains Cree of North America, Okichitaw is one of the few indigenous North American fighting styles to have survived into the Sixth World. The style is highly aggressive and focuses neutralizing opponents with rapid takedowns. The primary weapon used in Okichitaw is the gunstock war club, though the style also incorporates the tomahawk and dagger. Signature Technique: Close-Quarter Firearms (Longarms);
martialart.oni_ryu_taijutsu.desc=The Oni Do Kai is a group of Yakuza “ninja” (freelance operatives) composed almost entirely of orks and trolls. Early on, Oni Do Kai members recognized that their imposing size and strength would put them at a disadvantage in the same country that produced judo and jujutsu, and they began modifying their style of ninjutsu to turn those weaknesses into strengths—and thus, Oniryu taijutsu was born. Nobody’s quite sure why the Oni Do Kai decided to share their techniques with outsiders, but that hasn’t stopped orks and trolls around Japan (and in other countries with large Japanese communities) from signing up for classes in droves. After the Oni Do Kai went semi-public, other tusker-focused martial arts groups with their own styles (under names like Trog Kwan Do and Tuskrima, among others) followed suit, and the community is growing rapidly. Signature Technique: Oaken Stance;
martialart.parkour.desc=Not strictly a martial art, parkour was developed as a form of quick and effective movement through dense urban environments. Many of the techniques used in parkour can be adapted to martial arts practice, whether to gain a tactical advantage over an opponent or just run the hell away from a fight you shouldn’t have picked. Signature Technique: Rolling Clouds;
martialart.sangre_y_acero.desc=After the invention of functional cybernetic limbs in the 2030s, it was only a matter of time before someone designed cyberlimbs that were optimized for combat. Originating in the gladiator pits of Tenochtitlán, Sangre y Acero (also known as Etzilitzli and Ars Cybernetica) makes the best possible use of the advantages granted by cyberlimbs, especially against other melee weapons. Signature Technique: Iron Limbs;
martialart.tae_kwon_do.desc=Like its Japanese counterpart, karate, tae kwon do was synthesized from indigenous Korean fighting styles and external styles of kung fu imported from China.

Similar Styles: Savate (France); Signature Technique: Flying Kick;
martialart.the_cowboy_way.desc=Popularized by flatvids set in the American West, the art now referred to as the Cowboy Way—using the lasso to entangle enemies at range—arguably has its origins with the Huns and other nomadic cultures of central Asia. The additions of fisticuffs, gun-twirling, and ten-gallon hats are almost certainly American innovations. Given the similarities of the weapons, many of the techniques used in the Cowboy Way can also be applied to Similar Styles: Latigo y daga (Philippines), nawajutsu (Japan), whip fighting; Signature Technique: Entanglement;
martialart.wildcat.desc=When the Sioux Wildcats finally lifted their ban on cybernetics in unit members in 2080, it was anyone’s guess whether their in-house martial art would flourish or suffer because of it. The jury’s still out, but the style—a blend of Okichitaw, aikido, karate, and Muay Thai that focuses on disabling opponents as quickly as possible—is as effective as ever, particularly against non-augmented opponents (like the Wildcats’ arch-rivals, the Tír Ghosts). Signature Techniques: Releasing Talons;
martialart.wrestling.desc=Although “wrestling” is an extremely broad category (in much the same way as “kung fu”), in a general sense, wrestling consists of grabbing a part of your opponent’s body (or an item of clothing), then bending it into a pretzel or pinning them to the ground until they beg you to stop. In some cases, like in Japanese sumo, it’s possible to win matches by pushing the opponent out of the ring. Signature Technique: Sacrifice Throw;
quality.accident_prone.desc=When bad things happen, you’re a little worse than others at finding your way out of it. \r\n Game Effect: If you roll a glitch or a critical  glitch, you may not influence the outcome by spending Edge.

Game Effect: You cannot earn Edge or spend Edge in any form while suffering withdrawal.

Game Effect: You are considered Untrained for all Stealth tests in the astral plane. You can never take the masking metamagic. Assensing tests made against you get a free Edge, and all thresholds are reduced by 1. Astral Tracking tests made against you gain 2 Edge, and all thresholds are reduced by half.
quality.astral_chameleon.desc=Your aura never seems to stabilize for very long. You have the ability to blend in with the astral environment around you and make it harder to identify and read your aura and astral signature. Game Effect: Characters receive –2 dice on tests to recognize your aura or astral signature. Your astral signature fades in half the normal time (see p. 159).
quality.athletes_ways.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with any physical attribute instead of Body, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Athletics (the choice of physical attribute for drain is permanent at the time this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.attribute_mastery.desc=You have one particular part of you that just works out every time—when you have to rely on it, things just work out for you. \r\n Game Effect: Choose one of these attributes: Body, Agility, Reaction, Strength, Willpower, Intuition, or Charisma. You gain a bonus Edge when you make any test based on that attribute, unless you also gain an Edge due to your Attack Rating on that test. You may only take this quality once. This quality is also incompatible with Analytical Mind. If you take Analytical Mind, you may not take Attribute Mastery. If you take Attribute Mastery, you may not take Analytical Mind.
quality.bad_luck.desc=You were born under a bad sign, broke a mirror, spilled some salt, got the evil eye laid on you, or just can’t catch a break. No matter the reason, things just go wrong around you. Often. Game Effect: Glitches occur more frequently. Count dice showing both 1 and 2 for determining a glitch. This does not affect critical glitches, only regular glitches.
quality.bad_memories.desc=You can’t enjoy all those trids where the main character “faces their inner demons,” because they hit a little too close to home. Some nasty drek happened in the past, and it’s lurking around even today, popping up when you least expect it—and at the least convenient times. Game Effect: When you take (or are assigned) this quality, choose a subject of your Bad Memories. Whenever you’re required to be in the presence of that subject, you may only gain a maximum of one point of Edge per combat round, instead of the usual two.
quality.bad_rep.desc=Word on the street does not speak favorably of you. Maybe you lost a team or got kicked from a team for breaking during interrogation. Whatever it is, your reputation precedes you, and never in the way you want it to. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on Social tests. If you engage in a Teamwork test to assist a Social test, no one can spend Edge, and the opposing individual gains a point of Edge.
quality.beasts_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Intuition instead of Willpower. They may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Outdoors or Perception (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll), or they may choose to receive both the adept and magician benefits of their mentor spirit (purchased normally). The selection of which benefit to gain is made when the way is chosen.
quality.bermuda_gremlins.desc=Them be some special gremlins. They like to play with GridGuide and mimic the voice of the Pilot agent. Good luck on finding that hardcopy map in the glove compartment. They used it 2 rest stops ago.\r\n Game Effect: Whenever you are piloting a vehicle, roll 2D6. If either one rolls a 1, the gremlins have spoofed you somewhere along the route, and you’ve missed a turnoff. Now you are late as you try to re-route. Roll 1D6 and consult the following table to determine the duration of the delay:\r\n • 1–2 : 10–20 minutes late\r\n • 3–4: 30 minutes to an hour late\r\n • 5: 1–2 hours late\r\n • 6: 2+ hours, but you found a new little eatery. \r\n If both dice on the initial roll are 1s, you might have wandered into enemy/forbidden territory, and you’ll face significant hostility as you try to get out. Alternately, for simplicity’s sake, the gamemaster can just double the time rolled on the above table.
quality.blandness.desc=You are the least interesting person in the world. Average height, average weight, average build, average everything. Nothing at all about you tends to stand out, and that can be extremely useful. Game Effect: Characters take a –2 penalty on Memory tests (p. 67) to remember if they have seen you before, and the threshold on tests to notice if you are following or observing them is increased by 1.
quality.built_tough.desc=You’re built like a brick drekhouse. You’re pretty good at taking a few extra hits before the lights go out. Game Effect: You have a number of additional boxes on your Physical Condition Monitor equal to the rank of this quality.
quality.burnouts_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with one physical attribute modified via mundane augmentation instead of Body (the choice of which attribute is permanent when this way is taken). In addition, they may use their Innate Talent way ability (see above) one additional time per encounter for every full Essence point they are below 6.
quality.candle_in_the_darkness.desc=Some people trust those with Code of Honor and find themselves believing. Turns out that when people see a light in the darkness, they’re drawn to it. As long as the character doesn’t break their Code of Honor, all contacts are treated as having a Loyalty 2 higher than their actual rating. If CoH is broken, the contacts are treated as having 1 Loyalty less than their rating until the mistake can be corrected.
quality.catlike.desc=You have an innate grace usually seen only in the genus Felis that translates into smooth movements and a propensity for always landing on your feet—literally, if not figuratively. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge on all tests for balance, falling, and landing safely.
quality.combat_paralysis.desc=No matter how many times the street sam takes you to the range, you just can’t help but jump and freeze that first time they start shooting. Game Effect: Your Initiative Score is divided in half at the start of combat. You cannot take a Move or Sprint action in the first round, and you act last in that round. Your movement is restored to normal after the first round, but your Initiative Score is unchanged.
quality.compulsion.desc=Some people alleviate their suffering by stuffing themselves to the gills with illicit substances. You’ve chosen another way: a behavior you can’t help but indulge in, that’s less poisonous but equally toxic. This can represent anything from psychological addictions like gambling or Matrix gaming to “obsessive-compulsive” behaviors like arranging items in a certain order or repetitive handwashing. Game Effect: You must indulge in your chosen activity for a specified amount of time per day, depending on the level of the quality. Failing to do so results in you suffering withdrawal, inflicting a –2 dice pool penalty on all tests, increasing by 1 with each withdrawal period that elapses. As with the Addiction quality, you cannot earn Edge or spend Edge in any form while suffering withdrawal. However, like the modified Addiction quality described above, characters do not suffer the effects of the Anxiety, Depression, or Paranoia negative qualities while indulging their compulsion.
quality.dead_stick.desc=This driving thing—it may not be for you. We’re not saying you’re bad at it, but cockatrices don’t even try to cross the road when you’re behind the wheel.\r\n Game Effect: –2 dice pool penalty on all Crash tests.
quality.dependents.desc=Children, lovers, or something other, you have people relying on you for financial support. They live in your doss, eat your food, use your trid account, and generally cost you enough nuyen to keep you looking for that next score. Game Effect: Level 1 dependents cost 5 percent of any score goes to this person. Level 2 costs the runner 10 percent of every score. Level 3 costs the runner 25 percent of all their scores. For purposes of this quality, a “score” is any income that comes their way. Job payments, fencing stolen goods or paydata, or even gambling winnings. The people important to you prosper when you do!
quality.dermal_deposits.desc=You have calciferous deposits growing on or through your flesh, making you tougher and a little rough around the edges. Literally. Game Effect: You gain 1 level of natural Armor. Your Unarmed Melee attacks inflict Physical damage.
quality.dermal_deposits.desc=You have calciferous deposits growing on or through your flesh, making you tougher and a little rough around the edges. Literally. You gain 1 level of natural Armor.
quality.determination.desc=Your focus and will can lift your driving above the norm. \r\n Game Effect: Before making a Piloting test, you may declare an Edge boost or action. You may spend Minor Actions to reduce the cost of any Edge Boost or Actions on Piloting tests by 1 for each Minor Action spent, down to a minimum Edge cost of 1. If you do not immediately follow up the Minor Actions with a Piloting action, this effect is lost.
quality.distinctive_style.desc=You only fit in when you’re in places where no one fits in. The way you dress and look are unique to you. Game Effect: You cannot gain or spend Edge when you’re not rocking your distinctive look. Others get a +2 dice pool bonus when conducting a Memory test (p. 67) to recall your appearance or remember if they have seen you before.
quality.double_jointed.desc=Through practice or genetics, you’ve managed to make most of the joints in your body bend beyond normal metahuman ranges. Your hands narrow to as small as your wrists, your shoulders rotate and bend in every direction, your body folds neatly in half both forward and backward, and you can rotate your head to look behind you without turning your shoulders, just to name a few of your neatest party tricks. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge on all tests involving grappling, escaping bonds, flexibility, or fitting into tight spaces.
quality.driving_style_combat_ace.desc=High speeds and sharp turns aren’t dangerous enough for you. Whether it’s a dogfight in the sky, a combat biker game, or a running gun battle with the 405 Hellhounds on the freeway, you know how to put the hurt on while on the move.\r\n Game Effect: You only pay half the required Edge cost for the following uses of Edge (the new cost is shown in parentheses):\r\n • Attack Run (2 Edge)\r\n • Dead to Rights (3 Edge)\r\n • Crossfire (3 Edge)\r\n • Double Down (1,2, or 3 Edge only onEngineering [Gunnery] tests)\r\n
quality.driving_style_getaway_driver.desc=You know a few maneuvers that are handy when evading pursuit, which come in handy more often than you’d probably like.\r\n Game Effect: You only pay half the required Edge cost for the following uses of Edge:\r\n • Evade Pursuit (2 or 4 Edge)\r\n • Evasive Action (2 Edge)\r\n • Escape! (2 Edge)\r\n • Double Down (1,2, or 3 Edge) only on defense tests when piloting a vehicle\r\n
quality.driving_style_interceptor.desc=Sometimes you need to chase someone down. You know how to make sure they don’t get away.\r\n Game Effect: You only pay half the required Edge cost for the following uses of Edge:\r\n • Redline (2 Edge)\r\n • Focus (1 Edge)\r\n • In the Zone (2 Edge)\r\n • Double Down (1,2, or 3) Edge on any test made while chasing or shadowing a target.\r\n
quality.driving_style_reckless_driver.desc=You take risks whenever you get the chance, relying on the wild and chaotic nature of the chase and your own luck to get you through to the other side. There is no middle ground for you. You’re either going to win big or crash and burn. Or both! \r\n Game Effect: You only pay half the required Edge cost for the following uses:\r\n • Double Down only on Piloting tests (1,2, or 3 Edge)\r\n • Chicken (3 Edge)\r\n • Equalizer (1 Edge)\r\n • Up the Ante (1,2, or 3 Edge)\r\n
quality.driving_style_stunt_driver.desc=Starting with the legendary Evel Knievel, you idolize many of the vehicle stunts performed on the trid and no one is going to tell you that it’s all AROs and illusions.\r\n Game Effect: You only pay half the required Edge cost for the following uses of Edge:\r\n • Bootleg Turn (1 Karma)\r\n • Tokyo Drift (2 Karma)\r\n • Pickup (4 Karma)\r\n • The Exit (6 Karma)\r\n
quality.drone_animosity.desc=People say computers hate them. In this case, drones tend to give you attitude. Something about you annoys their algorithms. No one believes that the traffic drones are making you sit at the light longer than normal.\r\n Game Effect: In combat, drones tend to target you if given the choice. Your drones cop an attitude, no matter how many times you’ve reset the dogbrain. When not jumped into a drone, you cannot spend Edge to pilot them or when they are assisting you (for example, when gaining help from a pit crew or Engineering kits; see p. 164). And for every other drone, it’s only you they dislike, so it’s hard to prove or pin down (the gamemaster can decide how this plays out in the game).
quality.easy_mark.desc=No matter how hrd you try to focus and keep an eye out for trouble, people always manage to find a way to avoid your notice.\r\n Game Effect: You may not gain or spend Edge on Perception tests when opposing a Stealth test.
quality.elemental_resistance.desc=Through genetics or training, you have developed a powerful resistance and tolerance for certain forms of damaging energy (or lack of energy, in the case of cold). Game Effect: When choosing this quality, select an elemental form of damage (p. 109). When attacked with a weapon or spell (including unarmed combat by a spirit) that does this form of damage, gain a point of Edge before making your Defense test.
quality.elf_poser.desc=Your blood may be human or ork, but your ears, cheekbones, and hoity-toity attitude are all elf. A surgery here and there, maybe a Sperethiel class on the Matrix, and a lot of time watching footage of the Tír princes has you all set to join those you feel you truly belong with, no matter how round your ears or broad your tusks were at birth. Game Effect: Elves, orks, and trolls gain a point of Edge in Influence (Etiquette) tests made against you.
quality.exceptional_attribute.desc=Whether it’s being a powerhouse, taking a hit from a troll, holding your synthahol, ducking a fast right, holding that inside turn, selling coal in Newcastle, or making a cat look clumsy, you’re just naturally built to be better. Game Effect: Select a Physical or Mental attribute. That attribute's maximum (but not current) rank increases by 1. This quality can only be purchased once per attribute.
quality.first_impression.desc=You know how to make an entrance and make that first meeting the best meeting. Your wit, charm, and subtle flattery put everyone you meet off their guard and let you make the most of a first encounter. Game Effect: You gain 2 Edge for Social Tests during your first meeting with anyone, and both your Heat and Reputation are ignored for this first encounter.
quality.flashbacks.desc=You haven’t been able to leave behind the effects of a trauma you experienced, to the point where certain triggers make you relive the whole experience. Game Effect: When selecting this quality, choose a specific event that is the subject of the flashbacks. At least one, and possibly more, specific triggers should be identified. This should be multi-sensory and specific, so that it is not invoked regularly. When the character is subjected to the trigger, they must make a Composure (4) test or enter into a flashback. The flashback lasts three minutes. When the flashback starts, the character rolls a Composure (3) test; if they succeed, they recognize that they are in a flashback, and they are able to endure it. They receive a –4 dice pool penalty to any test involving Physical attributes for the duration. If they fail the second test, they cannot do anything but react to the flashback.
quality.focused_channeling.desc=Adepts focused on a way may resist the hardships of using mana by relying on their way-specific training and mindset, instead of the default fortitude attributes of basic adepts. This alternate drain attribute is not mandatory, but the decision to change or not must be made when a way is gained and cannot be altered thereafter (until and unless an adept changes their way; see the Finding Your Way metamagic, p. 84).
quality.focused_concentration.desc=You know how to compartmentalize your mind and keep hold of arcane and emergent manipulations without straining yourself. Game Effect: You can sustain multiple spells or complex forms without penalty. For each level, you can sustain 1 additional spell or complex form without suffering the associated penalty. The spell cannot have a modified Drain Value of 7 or greater.
quality.fuzz_magnet.desc=When you do something wrong on the streets, people notice. Especially the wrong people.\r\n Game Effect: Whenever driving recklessly or erratically (gamemaster discretion as to when that applies), roll two dice. If both dice come up as hits, you are noticed by local traffic police.
quality.gearhead.desc=If it’s meant to move but currently isn’t moving so well, you know how to get it back into tip-top shape in a jiffy. Game Effect: You gain an Edge on Repair tests for any vehicle and can spend Edge during downtime to make Extended Repair tests.
quality.glass_jaw.desc=Doesn’t take much to lay you on your hoop. You just never could take a punch. Game Effect: You have 1 less Stun Box for each level of this Quality, down to a minimum of 2.
quality.grease_monkey1.desc=When you were young, you would much rather make a trip to the junkyard than the toy store (possibly because kids in the barrens never have enough money to buy anything at the toy store). As you got older, the allure of discarded vehicle and machine parts on the heaps in junkyards was far stronger than the promise of some new toy. You not only loved monkeying around with these items, but you could often get the devices to work. \r\n Game Effect: Choose an Engineering specialization. At the 4 Karma level of this quality, the Base repair time is reduced by 10 minutes. At 8 Karma, the Base Threshold is reduced by 1.
quality.grease_monkey2.desc=When you were young, you would much rather make a trip to the junkyard than the toy store (possibly because kids in the barrens never have enough money to buy anything at the toy store). As you got older, the allure of discarded vehicle and machine parts on the heaps in junkyards was far stronger than the promise of some new toy. You not only loved monkeying around with these items, but you could often get the devices to work. \r\n Game Effect: Choose an Engineering specialization. At the 4 Karma level of this quality, the Base repair time is reduced by 10 minutes. At 8 Karma, the Base Threshold is reduced by 1.
quality.gremlins.desc=Any and every thing that could go wrong with some fidgety bit of tech in your hands has gone wrong at one point in your life. Game Effect: Whenever you use any device, roll 2D6. If you get a 1 on either die, it means the device fails to function correctly and can be treated as a glitch. The device can be quickly reset with a Minor Action and used again. Rolling snake eyes (double 1s) means the device fails catastrophically, and the roll can be treated like a critical glitch. The device is done for good and you might be in for a bit of hurt from shock or biofeedback.
quality.guts.desc=It’s not a lack of fear, just a lack of cowardice! You can stand up to the most intimidating opponents and hold your tongue under the toughest interrogations. Game Effect: You gain an Edge when resisting Intimidation or effects that cause the Frightened status.
quality.hardening.desc=Get clipped by IC and other personas enough times in the Matrix, and you can start to build defenses against it. Your physical form actually helps absorb some of the injuries coming at your Matrix persona. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge when making Matrix Damage Resistance tests. If you do not use that point of Edge immediately on the Damage Resistance test, it goes away. When struck by any damage in the Matrix, you can convert up to two boxes to Stun Damage, rather than Matrix damage, protecting your persona at the cost of yourself.
quality.high_pain_tolerance.desc=Pain is but an illusion of the mind. Either that, or you were born with congenital analgesia. Either way, you don’t suffer the ill effects of injury and pain like others. Game Effect: When wounded, reduce your wound penalty by one (to a minimum of 0).
quality.home_ground.desc=Spend enough time somewhere, and you get to know it like the back of your hand. In the local neighborhood, you know every turn, every back alley, every shop on the block, the local rivalries and romances, and you can use all of it to your advantage. In the Matrix, you’ve spent countless hours in the code, you know its gremlins, its quirks, the local avatars, and the ones that are out of place. Game Effect: Select a neighborhood or Matrix host each time you take this quality. Outdoors and Perception tests made in your Home Ground gain an Edge for use on that test; if you do not use the Edge on that test, it goes away.
quality.honorbound.desc=You have a code. You live by the code. You die by the code. Game Effect: You cannot spend or earn Edge for twenty-four hours after you break a tenet of your code. If the same tenet is broken multiple times or broken again during the twenty-four hour period, each infraction adds another forty-eight hours onto the initial twenty-four. If a different tenet is broken, it’s twenty-four hours for that one added to any current infractions, and the same rules apply for additional violations.
quality.human-looking.desc=Small orks, tall dwarfs, and ugly elves do exist. Whether through genetics or modifications, you do not look like your birth metatype; you appear human. The points in your ears are easily overlooked, your tusks are filed down to mere teeth, your cheekbones are rounder, your legs longer— that sort of thing. You can pass for human, which might help with humans or cause obstacles with non-humans. Game Effect: You generally appear human at first glance and gain +2 dice on Disguise tests to hide your metatype and appear more human.
quality.impaired.desc=Some folks are just not meant to be naturally talented. A bum knee, poor genetics, or an illness as a kid has you lacking the maximum achievement level of your peers. Game Effect: For each level, the character’s maximum for the chosen attribute decreases by 1, to a minimum of 2.
quality.in_debt.desc=You’ve built up a bit of debt trying to get a foothold in the shadows. Game Effect: When you spend Karma for cash, every point of Karma you spend gets you 5,000 instead of 2,000 nuyen. Each point of Karma spent also puts you 5,000 nuyen into debt with someone very dangerous and capable of collecting. You must pay a monthly interest rate of 500 nuyen per Karma spent, in addition to any payment to the principal. If the interest is not paid, the lenders come searching for you. The quality can be bought off purely with money; if the principal is repaid the quality is eliminated.
quality.incompetent.desc=No matter how much you practice and try to figure it out, there are some skills you just can’t manage to get right. Game Effect: When this quality is chosen, select a skill. You are unable to gain ranks in the selected skill. You cannot be Incompetent in skills you have no chance to perform — so you cannot choose this quality for Magic skills if you do not have a Magic rating, and you cannot choose it for Tasking if you do not have a Resonance rating. This skill may only be selected once.
quality.indomitable.desc=Whether through deep studies, natural selection,or intense training, your mind is hard to break. You can hold out longer under interrogation, shrug off mild injuries with ease, and hold your mind against the onslaught of incoming mana. Game Effect: Edge Boost costs are reduced by 1 on tests involving Willpower.
quality.innate_talent.desc=The focus and dedication that come from traveling on a way grant an adept the ability to routinely bolster their adept abilities in small ways. Once per encounter, they may reduce the costs of Edge boosts by one on any test that is modified in any way by an adept power or metamagic technique. For every level of initiation, this ability can be used one additional time per encounter.
quality.insomnia.desc=Sleep? What’s that? You just can’t get a good night’s rest. Game Effect: Without proper rest, you can’t regain Edge or spend it as you might like. Each day the runner must make a Body + Willpower (3) test to get a successful night of rest. If they fail, they cannot earn more than two Edge from any source that day. Also, they cannot spend more than 2 Edge on any given test. The purchase and use of a sleep regulator reduces the threshold on the test to 1. The runner can also purchase medication (50 nuyen/dose) that reduces the threshold to 2.
quality.invisible_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Agility instead of Body, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Stealth or Perception (select one skill when this way is taken, but choose to include a wild die from roll to roll).
quality.junkyard_king1.desc=It’s a Harley … compatible … thing … basically the same, only with parts not made by the original manufacturers. You could spend more for the name-brand parts, but between you and me, it’s the same subcontractor out of Atzlan, just taking a detour through Hong Kong. \r\n Game Effect: The PC has more options available to repair or customize their drone or vehicle with less than adequate parts. At 4 Karma, reduce availability of the parts by 1 when looking for used parts (see p. 162, Edge test). At 8 Karma, reduce the threshold penalty by 1 when using used parts for repair test (see p. 164).
quality.junkyard_king2.desc=It’s a Harley … compatible … thing … basically the same, only with parts not made by the original manufacturers. You could spend more for the name-brand parts, but between you and me, it’s the same subcontractor out of Atzlan, just taking a detour through Hong Kong. \r\n Game Effect: The PC has more options available to repair or customize their drone or vehicle with less than adequate parts. At 4 Karma, reduce availability of the parts by 1 when looking for used parts (see p. 162, Edge test). At 8 Karma, reduce the threshold penalty by 1 when using used parts for repair test (see p. 164).
quality.juryrigger.desc=When you don’t have the time or the parts to do it right, you can still get it done. Whether it’s slapping on duct tape, twisting together wires that maybe shouldn’t be connected, or just giving the thing a swift kick, you find a creative way to get a machine working, even if only briefly. Game Effect: When performing a Juryrigging test (see p. 95), you gain a point of Edge that must be spent on that test, or it goes away.
quality.long_reach.desc=Whether it’s because of long arms, long legs, or some exceptional physical grace, you are able to reach people with melee weapons easier than others. Game Effect: When you are using a melee weapon, Close range is extended to 5 meters instead of 3.
quality.loss_confidence.desc=Imposter syndrome, a single traumatic failure, or just too many rejections or small failures in life ave left you doubting yourself at every turn. Game Effect: During any encounter, the runner must make a Willpower (2) test as a Minor Action. Failure means they cannot earn or spend Edge for the entire encounter.
quality.low_light_vision.desc=Thanks to an increase in the number of rod cells in your natural eyes, an implanted increase of said rod cells, or an augmentation that enhances the light level of incoming data, you are capable of operating in light levels that would leave others essentially blind. Game Effect: You can see clearly in any light level that is not total darkness (see Environment and Visibility, p. 118).
quality.low_pain_tolerance.desc=You’ve got sensitive nerves or a generally sensitive nature. For whatever reason, you are more affected by injuries and discomfort. Game Effect: All wound modifiers are doubled.
quality.magic_resistance.desc=You could have been born under a blood moon, filled your body with foreign substances, or had bits of your soul sucked out by a spirit or vampire. For good or ill, mana just doesn’t seem to want to connect with you. Whether it’s a manabolt trying to melt your brain, a fireball trying to cook you alive, or a healing spell trying to mend your wounds, it’s just harder to get magic to work on you. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge for use on any Magic Resistance test; if you do not use it on that test, that point goes away. When a Health spell is cast on you, treat your Essence as if it were 2 points lower than it actually is.
quality.magicians_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with their tradition attribute instead of Willpower, and they may either swap in a wild die on any roll made for Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, or Sorcery (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a Wild Die or not from roll to roll), or they may choose to receive both the Adept and Magician benefits of their mentor spirit (purchased normally). The selection of which benefit to gain is made when the way is chosen.
quality.massive_network.desc=The character spends an obscene amount of time socializing, gathering friends from all rugs of society. This quality is often seen in fixers, newspaper editors, schoolteachers with two decades of graduates, and world-famous musicians—the type of people who seem to know everybody. The cost of all contacts is reduced by 2, to a minimum cost of 2. This does not stack with Networker.
quality.maybe_you_missed_something.desc=With threats lurking everywhere, the only person you trust to spot danger is yourself, even if you’re not always the best person for the job. Game Effect: Whenever you’re in a potentially dangerous situation, you must take any feasible steps to search out potential threats. If another member of the team has already done so, you must spend at least as much time as they did completing the same task, with all the exasperation that entails (like the decker chewing out the street samurai for “checking their work”).
quality.mentor_spirit.desc=You believe in something other than yourself to help guide and channel your magic, and that something believes in you. Whether it be the totem of Wolf, the Norse god Loki, or the Christian God, you utilize your beliefs to shape and focus your arcane abilities more easily. Game Effect: You gain the benefits listed with the description of your mentor spirit (see p. 162). If you fail to keep aligned with one of those tenets, you lose your faith and connection to your mentor and all associated bonuses.
quality.motion_sickness.desc=Yes, there is a strong benefit from being able to move from place to place, but the journey does not agree with you. Rolling down the window doesn’t help; it just means you’ll have to wash the car later.\r\n Game Effect: Any time you are in a moving vehicle for longer than thirty minutes, you gain the nausea status (p. 52, SR6). This nausea status doesn’t go away until ten minutes after the vehicle stops moving. The Nausea test to recover is only temporary, lasting (net hits) minutes.
quality.motorpool1.desc=Like the face having contacts, a rigger can invest in a plethora of chop shops, junkyards, surplus, and used vehicle lots. From these, the rigger can gain access to various forms of transportation outside their own vehicle. \r\n Game Effect: At 3 points of Karma, Free Ride. The character always knows how to get around. Once a day with a successful Influence + Charisma (4) test, the character can get a free ride in some form of transportation (mass transit, hitchhike, party bus, etc) to get them near the desired location. At 6 points of Karma, Replacement Vehicle. The character gains the Free Ride benefit, but instead of just getting a ride, they can spend 2 Edge to receive a stock version of their normal vehicle for personal use for one day with no charge. At 9 points of Karma, Alternate Transportation. With a successful Influence + Charisma (4) test, the character can spend 4 Edge to access special transportation (plane, ship, sub, etc) to use as they see fit for one day. The gamemaster has final say on just what is available to the PC. \r\n Note: If the PC returns a vehicle damaged, the character must pay for the repairs or repair it themselves. This can include paying in favors. All Motorpool quality effects are cumulative.
quality.motorpool2.desc=Like the face having contacts, a rigger can invest in a plethora of chop shops, junkyards, surplus, and used vehicle lots. From these, the rigger can gain access to various forms of transportation outside their own vehicle. \r\n Game Effect: At 3 points of Karma, Free Ride. The character always knows how to get around. Once a day with a successful Influence + Charisma (4) test, the character can get a free ride in some form of transportation (mass transit, hitchhike, party bus, etc) to get them near the desired location. At 6 points of Karma, Replacement Vehicle. The character gains the Free Ride benefit, but instead of just getting a ride, they can spend 2 Edge to receive a stock version of their normal vehicle for personal use for one day with no charge. At 9 points of Karma, Alternate Transportation. With a successful Influence + Charisma (4) test, the character can spend 4 Edge to access special transportation (plane, ship, sub, etc) to use as they see fit for one day. The gamemaster has final say on just what is available to the PC. \r\n Note: If the PC returns a vehicle damaged, the character must pay for the repairs or repair it themselves. This can include paying in favors. All Motorpool quality effects are cumulative.
quality.motorpool3.desc=Like the face having contacts, a rigger can invest in a plethora of chop shops, junkyards, surplus, and used vehicle lots. From these, the rigger can gain access to various forms of transportation outside their own vehicle. \r\n Game Effect: At 3 points of Karma, Free Ride. The character always knows how to get around. Once a day with a successful Influence + Charisma (4) test, the character can get a free ride in some form of transportation (mass transit, hitchhike, party bus, etc) to get them near the desired location. At 6 points of Karma, Replacement Vehicle. The character gains the Free Ride benefit, but instead of just getting a ride, they can spend 2 Edge to receive a stock version of their normal vehicle for personal use for one day with no charge. At 9 points of Karma, Alternate Transportation. With a successful Influence + Charisma (4) test, the character can spend 4 Edge to access special transportation (plane, ship, sub, etc) to use as they see fit for one day. The gamemaster has final say on just what is available to the PC. \r\n Note: If the PC returns a vehicle damaged, the character must pay for the repairs or repair it themselves. This can include paying in favors. All Motorpool quality effects are cumulative.
quality.networker.desc=This character has an extensive social network of loose friends and casual contacts. This quality is often found in reporters, business managers, and small-time musicians who may cast a wide but shallow social net. The cost of all contacts is reduced by 1, to a minimum cost of 1.
quality.ork_poser.desc=Your blood may be human or elf, but your ears, jaw, tusks, and rough attitude are all ork. Game Effect: Elves, orks, and trolls gain a point of Edge in Influence (Etiquette) tests made against you.
quality.pacifist.desc=You are one of the few people remaining in the Sixth World who not only believes that violence isn’t the answer, but who actively tries to avoid violence whenever possible— even against people who get so fed up with your peaceful ways that they want to smack you. This quality may not be taken together with the White Hat version of the Honorbound quality, but may be taken with other versions of the Honorbound Quality at the gamemaster’s discretion. (We recommend that this quality and the Honorbound quality be taken together when this quality would impose a more severe limitation than the Honorbound quality alone would.) As the name implies, this quality limits the ways in which a character may use violence against other characters. If the character knowingly acts against their pacifist beliefs, they may not spend or earn Edge for twenty-four hours after committing the violent act. Any violent act committed during that twenty-four hours extends the duration of not being able to spend or regain Edge by another 24 hours. Level 1: You may only initiate violence (i.e., act in a way that results in damage being inflicted on a target) to stop a clear, imminent threat to another character, such as a hostile NPC aiming a weapon at them. You may take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage on a target, but only if they could reasonably survive the damage inflicted. Level 2: You may not initiate violence under any circumstances, but you may attack targets who have already proven themselves to be a threat to you or others. You may take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage to a target, but only if they could reasonably survive the damage inflicted. Level 3: You may not initiate violence under any circumstances, but you may attack targets who have already proven themselves to be a threat to you or others. You may not knowingly take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage to a target, but you may still take actions that would result in inflicting Stun damage to a target. Level 4: You may not knowingly commit a violent act for any reason, even in defense of yourself or others.
quality.perforated_firewall.desc=Maybe it’s bad luck, or maybe it’s because you keep hitting the wrong links on the Matrix, but any firewall you touch seems to start to crumble.\r\n Game Effect: Whenever you must make a test using a device’s Firewall, your opponent gains a point of Edge.
quality.phobia_common.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.phobia_rare.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.phobia_uncommon.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.phobia_very_rare.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.photographic_memory.desc=Most people store life in clips, but you keep the recording running all the time. It’s a ton of information to deal with at times, but it has made you great for trivia night and remembering the favorite color of your childhood friend. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge point when making a Memory test (p. 67). If you do not use this point of Edge on the test, it goes away.
quality.possession_tradition.desc=The conjurer has never learned to summon spirits in a way that allows them to manifest in the physical realm, or, for some reason, consciously abstains from doing so. This quality can only be taken by characters who qualify for the Conjuring skill. Game Effect: Spirits summoned in this tradition have their Materialization power replaced with the Possession power (p. 69).
quality.prejudiced.desc=You have some deep-seated views and beliefs about a certain group, and no matter what anyone says, you know they’re no good. Game Effect: Select a specific group or type of people. You are unable to gain or use Edge while the object of your prejudice is present (unless you’re directly opposing them).
quality.pusillanimous_summoner.desc=Be it because of an unpleasant experience in the past, or the peculiarities of their arcane upbringing — whenever summoning a spirit, the magician is stricken with awe. Sensing the discomfort, the spirit gains the upper hand and tends to execute the conjurer’s demands precisely by the word — no more, but, if it feels like it, considerably less. (Along the way, the spirit will display either a very twisty or snotty behavior, depending on the magician’s tradition.) A pusillanimous summoner has to be very precise about their wording, unless they don’t mind being given the runaround by the spirit. This quality can only be taken by characters who qualify for the Conjuring skill. Game Effect: Spirits summoned by the magician try their best to misinterpret the summoner’s orders (at the gamemaster’s discretion). If the magician wants to be sure there are no loopholes in their instructions, they have to sit down before the conjuring and perform a Conjuring + Intuition (8, 5 mins) Extended test to think those instructions through.
quality.quick_healer.desc=You tend to heal from injury quicker than your peers, which is incredibly valuable in a profession that is all about putting your body on the line. Game Effect: Cut the interval for any natural healing test (p. 120) in half, meaning you can heal Stun Damage after half an hour and Physical Damage after half a day.
quality.remote_pilot.desc=Driving is a fine thing to do—unless you’re actually in the vehicle, where all that movement is just too disorienting. You prefer to drive at a remove. \r\n Game Effect: You may not gain or spend Edge when piloting a vehicle unless you are not physically present within the vehicle.
quality.representation1.desc=Some arcane teachers offer their students auxiliary techniques, called representations, to support their learning. While many students, becoming more and more confident, overcome those techniques little by little, others decide to maintain them, finding them comforting and helpful. This quality is not available for adepts. Game Effect: The magician defines a clearly visible or audible act—gestures, spoken words, chants, and the like—that must be performed whenever they use arcane powers; alternatively, there’s a special garb or outfit (or even the total lack of any textiles) that must be worn. The act or garb can’t be casual or misinterpretable (e.g., as colloquial clothing or a fashion statement) but should raise suspicions, even with mundane people, that something mojo-related is going on.  In the quality’s simple form (I), the magician can abstain from using their representation, but they have to accept a –4 dice pool penalty on all Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, and Sorcery rolls when not wearing the representation. Another drawback of this quality is that it points out to the magician’s enemies that they are the “dangerous one,” and if the enemies follow the old credo “kill the mage first,” this puts the magician in mortal danger. Along with all those downsides comes an upside; once per day, when the magician uses their representation while using arcane powers, they gain one point of situational Edge that can only be spent for that test.
quality.representation2.desc=Some arcane teachers offer their students auxiliary techniques, called representations, to support their learning. While many students, becoming more and more confident, overcome those techniques little by little, others decide to maintain them, finding them comforting and helpful.

Game Effect: The magician defines a clearly visible or audible act—gestures, spoken words, chants, and the like—that must be performed whenever they use arcane powers; alternatively, there’s a special garb or outfit (or even the total lack of any textiles) that must be worn. The act or garb can’t be casual or misinterpretable (e.g., as colloquial clothing or a fashion statement) but should raise suspicions, even with mundane people, that something mojo-related is going on. In its more pronounced form (II), if the magician is unable to use their representation (e.g., because they are gagged, hands are tied, or the garb is removed), they are effectively hindered from performing any magic and cannot use the Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, and Sorcery skills. Another drawback of this quality is that it points out to the magician’s enemies that they are the “dangerous one,” and if the enemies follow the old credo “kill the mage first,” this puts the magician in mortal danger. Along with all those downsides comes an upside; once per day, when the magician uses their representation while using arcane powers, they gain one point of situational Edge that can only be spent for that test.
quality.resistance_pathogens.desc=When you claim, “I’ve never been sick a day in my life,” there’s a good chance it may be true. You have a very healthy immune system that has mastered the art of fighting off any and all comers that try to slip into your body and make you sick. Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when you make a Pathogen Resistance test. If you do not use it on that test, it goes away.
quality.returned_soldier_part1.desc=The character served in a military at some point, only to vanish off the face of the Earth for a time. They have now come back, but the experience is hazy. They have some memories of a vast city called Dis and being held in a maze-like building against their will, but other memories refuse to surface. On their return, they find their body and mind have changed, giving them new abilities. Select two powers from the list starting on p. 141 and one characteristic from the list on p. 142. (Slip Streams)
quality.returned_soldier_part2.desc=The character served in a military at some point, only to vanish off the face of the Earth for a time. They have now come back, but the experience is hazy. They have some memories of a vast city called Dis and being held in a maze-like building against their will, but other memories refuse to surface. On their return, they find their body and mind have changed, giving them new abilities. Select two powers from the list starting on p. 141 and one characteristic from the list on p. 142. (Slip Streams)
quality.returned_soldier_part3.desc=The character served in a military at some point, only to vanish off the face of the Earth for a time. They have now come back, but the experience is hazy. They have some memories of a vast city called Dis and being held in a maze-like building against their will, but other memories refuse to surface. On their return, they find their body and mind have changed, giving them new abilities. Select two powers from the list starting on p. 141 and one characteristic from the list on p. 142. (Slip Streams)
quality.road_rage.desc=You’ve braved the roads of the Sixth World long enough to be perpetually on edge when you’re out there. If someone does you wrong, you snap and can think of nothing more than getting them back. \r\n Game Effect: If the vehicle or drone that you are piloting takes damage, you may only gain or spend Edge on Opposed tests against the target that damaged you until either the encounter ends or your target is defeated.
quality.scholastic_mage.desc=A considerable share of mages—especially in the hermetic traditions—do not undergo training with a personal teacher but attend university classes instead. Granted, an academic education costs a considerable amount of money, logic tradition qualities but it certainly pays off in terms of mediated knowledge. Game Effect: During character creation only, mages can buy Knowledge Skills for 2 Karma each. They can also buy Knowledge skills with their starting nuyen (p. 68, SR6) at a cost of 1,000 nuyen per Knowledge skill. This quality can be combined with the In Debt quality; however, this raises the cost per Knowledge skill to 2,000 nuyen.
quality.scorched.desc=A Matrix, simsense, or BTL experience has fried your neurons to the point of perpetual frazzle, causing trouble when you’re logged on, even when it’s just AR. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge while accessing the Matrix. This includes through use of commlinks, smartlinks, and any other source of data coming in from the ether.
quality.sensitive_system.desc=Your body does not like to have anything grafted or merged with it that isn’t part of its natural code. Game Effect: Essence costs are doubled for all cyberware, bioware, and nanoware. Geneware suffers no ill effects.
quality.shamanic_mask.desc=Some magicians channel their arcane powers through their mentor spirit. In turn, as part of their action, the totem begins to manifest itself through a visible, temporary transformation (animalistic features, elemental effects, etc.). The transformation is mana-based, so only living beings catch the transformation. The more successes in the magic test, the more pronounced the transformation and the more identifiable the totem is to even the mundane. Game Effect: The mage defines one effect (e.g., a translucent wolf’s face covering their features, their eyes glowing in arcane fire). This effect accompanies the use of any skill involving magic (or for adepts, every activation of an adept power). Investing a Minor Action (in addition to the action required in using the corresponding magical skill), the magician gains one Edge. This Edge is only temporary and can only be used for the test (Adepts: for the first test involving the activated Adept power). There’s a downside, too: the Shamanic Mask inevitably exposes the mage as Awakened. This may draw the enemies’ fire towards them, putting them in mortal danger.
quality.signature_maneuver.desc=You have your own special move that you keep doing for one simple reason: It keeps working. And it looks cool. So, two reasons. \r\n Game Effect: Choose a combination of two specific Edge boosts or actions, and either a skill or Defense test. Come up with a name and description for your signature maneuver, such as the “Crazy Ivan” or “Devil Rat Boogie.” You may combine the two selected uses of Edge together on a single test (paying the full cost for each use of Edge), but only when using the selected skill. You must declare and spend your Edge before you roll. You may still use Edge boosts or actions that would normally be chosen after the dice are rolled, but you must commit to them before rolling the dice. For example, you may have a signature maneuver that allows you to combine the Edge boosts “reroll all failed dice” with “reroll one die” when making Defense tests. When you make a Defense test, you might declare your signature maneuver, spending 4 Edge to reroll all failed dice and 1 or more additional Edge to force your attacker to reroll one or more dice. Normally, you might wait to see how many hits you score before deciding to reroll failures, or make sure your attacker has at least one hit before committing to forcing them to reroll a die, but you have to commit to using your full signature maneuver in advance.\r\n You may take this quality multiple times. Each time it is selected, create a new signature maneuver. Note: While this might seem aimed at riggers and other pilots, a signature maneuver can be invented for any skill and Edge boost/action combination. Below are a number of examples. Any of these could be renamed, and most could apply to a different skill. Get creative!\r\n \r\n Examples:\r\n • Sidewinder Sizzle: Combine Double Down (add wild dice) and Tokyo Drift (prevents pursuers from gaining on you) on a Piloting test.\r\n • Alpha Strike: Combine Double Down (add wild dice) and Anticipation (attack multiple targets, each with your full dice pool) on an Engineering test.\r\n • The Jazz Smile: Combine +1 to a single die roll with Big Speech (teamwork test your own Influence test) on an Influence test.\r\n • Bad Luck Blast: Combine reroll one or more dice with count 2s as glitches for the target on a Firearms test.\r\n • Five Finger Discount: Combine add Edge to your dice pool (with exploding sixes) with Wrest (take melee weapon away on a successful Block) on a Close Combat test.\r\n • Flip Dash: Combine Equalizer (negate all position advantages) with Up the Ante (increase the threshold for yourself and others in a chase) on an Athletics test.\r\n • Hand of God: Combine buy one automatic hit with reroll one die on a Biotech test. \r\n • Kick It up a Notch: Combine add edge to your dice pool (with exploding sixes) with buy one hit on an Enchanting test.\r\n • Magic Missile: Combine reroll one die with negate 1 Edge of a foe on a Sorcery test.\r\n • Matrix Dodge: Combine add Edge to your dice pool (with exploding sixes) with reroll one die on a Defense test.\r\n • Polite Request: Combine reroll one die with +1 to a single die roll on a Conjuring test. \r\n • Seattle Swindle: Combine Double Down (add wild dice) with Bring the Drama (make some quick nuyen) on a Con test.\r\n • Somebody Else’s Problem: Combine Sudden Insight (Stealth) with add Edge to your dice pool (with exploding sixes) on a Stealth test.\r\n • Whiplash: Combine Called Shot Vitals with Negate 1 Edge of a foe on an Exotic Weapons test.\r\n
quality.silver_lining.desc=When things go wrong, you find a way to make something good out of it. Eventually. \r\n Game Effect: Whenever you glitch, gain an Edge. Whenever you critically glitch, your Edge pool is filled to its max of 7. The glitch or critical glitch effects still take place. If the glitch is somehow prevented, you do not gain Edge from this quality.
quality.simsense_vertigo.desc=Whenever you log onto the Matrix in VR, your disorientation is nauseating. Game Effect: You cannot gain or spend Edge while accessing the Matrix via VR. You also receive the Nauseated status (p. 52) for one hour after you log off the Matrix.
quality.sinner.desc=You have a legitimate SIN that links back to biometric data. You have enough attachment to it, whether for your own or family purposes, that you can’t just burn it. Game Effect: You pay taxes to the issuer of your SIN (megacorp or nation). 10 percent increase in the cost of the lifestyle associated with this SIN. You are easier to track or identify, giving opponents a point of Edge when they attempt Trace Icon action against you.
quality.social_stress.desc=Social situations that simply does not work for you, like being in large groups, talking to new people, being the center of attention. Game Effect: Select a specific social stressor. When encountering your social stressor, you must make a Charisma (2) test as a Minor Action. Failure means you cannot earn or spend Edge until you succeed. You can choose not to take the test but if so, any tests made against you gain a bonus Edge.
quality.sore_thumb.desc=Simply put, no matter where you go, you stick out.\r\n Game Effect: You may not gain or spend Edge on Stealth tests.
quality.spark_of_brilliance.desc=Finally, followers of ways receive some other minor enhancement to their magical power, as listed below, generally reflecting a greater trust in their magical ability that may prove inconsistent at times, but truly impressive when innate knacks and experience align properly.
quality.speakers_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Charisma instead of Willpower, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Con or Influence (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.specialist.desc=You have some hard-earned skills, but they came at a price. There is one thing you’re particularly good at, but your focus there made you less good at other things,\r\n Game Effect: Choose one of your skills. When using that skill for anything not covered under a specialization or expertise, you may not gain or spend Edge.
quality.speed_racer.desc=You can drive fast, but it’s always faster when you have someone to beat—or catch. \r\n Game Effect: When you are in a chase or race, gain a point of Edge at the start of every round. This Edge can only go into your Chase pool (p. 175).
quality.spirit_affinity.desc=You have earned respect among a particular group of spirits/sprites. Through actions and favors, you’ve gained a positive reputation that makes them treat you with extra consideration. Game Effect: When selecting this quality, choose a type of spirit or sprite. You gain a bonus point of Edge when making a Conjuring or Tasking test for your chosen class of spirits/sprites. This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spirits/sprites each time.
quality.spirit_bane.desc=The reason doesn’t matter—what matters is the fact that a certain type of spirit/sprite has an inherent dislike for you. Game Effect: Choose a type of spirit or sprite. Spirits/sprites from that category gain a bonus point of Edge when you attempt a Conjuring or Tasking test against them. Can be taken multiple times with new class of spirits/sprites each time. In combat, spirits/sprites of the chosen type will attack you first and relentlessly, resulting in savaging a dead body or bricking a deck if they have nothing else to do.
quality.sprite_affinity.desc=You have earned respect among a particular group of spirits/sprites. Through actions and favors, you’ve gained a positive reputation that makes them treat you with extra consideration. Game Effect: When selecting this quality, choose a type of spirit or sprite. You gain a bonus point of Edge when making a Conjuring or Tasking test for your chosen class of spirits/sprites. This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spirits/sprites each time.
quality.sprite_bane.desc=The reason doesn’t matter—what matters is the fact that a certain type of spirit/sprite has an inherent dislike for you. Game Effect: Choose a type of spirit or sprite. Spirits/sprites from that category gain a bonus point of Edge when you attempt a Conjuring or Tasking test against them. Can be taken multiple times with new class of spirits/sprites each time. In combat, spirits/sprites of the chosen type will attack you first and relentlessly, resulting in savaging a dead body or bricking a deck if they have nothing else to do.
quality.stolen_gear.desc=You went out and took what you wanted, and damn the consequences. Someone now wants their stuff back. The player and gamemaster must decide on the exact details, but the benefit is that for each point of Karma (up to 20) spent on Stolen Gear, the character gets 10,000 nuyen (see below) to spend on gear, cyberware, and/or bioware during character creation. These points are spent instead of the normal Karma for extra cash (not in addition to), and extend the possible additional funds to 150,000¥. This nuyen must be spent on gear, cyberware, or bioware. Any nuyen left over does not convert into nuyen that the character can keep. They’ll be putting a large bounty on your head (worth at least 25,000 nuyen) and sending other runners after you.
quality.target_fixation.desc=You are super-aware of who is coming after you in a fight—which limits your overall situational awareness and sometimes makes you forget who else is out there.\r\n Game Effect: If you attack, you may not gain or spend Edge on Defense tests except against the target of your attack for the remainder of this combat round.
quality.thermographic_vision.desc=Thanks to enhancements or just genetics, your vision allows you to see differences in temperature on and around objects and people, though most of the time ambient regular light overrides the heat signature. Large local sources of heat can create a glare of sorts, but usually something giving off that much heat is also giving off light, so your regular vision takes over. Game Effect: You can see the heat of objects in total darkness (assuming they are warmer or colder than the ambient temperature), allowing you to operate in such conditions.
quality.toughness.desc=Whether it’s mental training, a physical regimen of self-inflicted injury, or you’re just one tough bastard, you can take a bit more of a beating and shrug off the injuries better than most. Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when making Damage Resistance tests. If you do not use it on the test, it goes away.
quality.toxin_resistance.desc=Whether through naturally superior organs or because you think getting bit by a snake on a daily basis is a fun way to pass the time, you’re able to better resist the effects of toxins in the Sixth World.  Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when you make a Toxin Resistance test (p. 121). If you do not use it on that test, it goes away.
quality.uncouth.desc=At some point in life, the filter between your thoughts and your mouth disappeared. You consider yourself brutally honest, but others tend to see you as rude and abrasive. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Charisma.
quality.underdog.desc=You’re not a front-runner. When you’re behind, you feel inspired to do your best work. Or go out in a blaze of glory. \r\n Game Effect: Whenever anyone has a position advantage against you in a chase (see p. 175), add a wild die to all of your Piloting tests.
quality.uneducated.desc=You have a definite lack in your basic education. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Logic.
quality.unsteady_hands.desc=You can’t draw a straight line to save your life. You also have a real hard time typing, tying your shoes, and keeping a gunsight on the target. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Agility that directly involves your hands (that is, a Stealth test to pull off sleight-of-hand would directly involve the hands, as would an Attack test with any weapon held in the hands, but an Athletics test involving running would not, even though the hands are in motion while running).
quality.vehicle_empathy1.desc=You seem to understand vehicles better than most people and can coax a little more performance through physical contact. \r\n Game Effect: When piloting a vehicle of that specialization, Acceleration and Speed Interval are increased by 2. At the 4 Karma level, the character only gains this benefit when they are manually driving the vehicle. At the 8 Karma level, the character gains the benefit when they are physically connected to the
quality.vehicle_empathy2.desc=You seem to understand vehicles better than most people and can coax a little more performance through physical contact. \r\n Game Effect: When piloting a vehicle of that specialization, Acceleration and Speed Interval are increased by 2. At the 4 Karma level, the character only gains this benefit when they are manually driving the vehicle. At the 8 Karma level, the character gains the benefit when they are physically connected to the
quality.warriors_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with any physical attribute instead of Body, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Close Combat or Firearms (the choice of which drain attribute to use and the choice of which skill for wild die manipulation are both permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.weak_immune_system.desc=You’re sick almost all the time. It may just be a minor cold, or it could be a nasty case of influenza or worse, but you’ve never met an infection you didn’t want to take home and hang out with for a bit. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge to resist the effects of an infection. The threshold for fighting off any infection you are exposed to is increased by 1. While suffering the ill effects of an illness, you suffer a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests.
quality.will_to_live.desc=No matter how hard the hit, you have the tenacity to hold on to the bitter end. You are quite capable of taking a .50-cal round to the chest and waking up in the hospital, rather than never waking up at all. Game Effect: For every rank of this quality you possess, you gain two additional Damage Overflow boxes (see p. 121).
spell.acid_stream.desc=These spells shoot acid at targets, doing immediate damage while also doing Chemical damage(p. 109) and giving hit targets the Corroded status (p. 52) with a rating equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test.
spell.acid_toxic_wave.desc=These spells shoot acid at targets, doing immediate damage while also doing Chemical damage(p. 109) and giving hit targets the Corroded status (p. 52) with a rating equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test.
spell.agony.desc=This spell brings pain but not actual damage.Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower + Logic; each net hit acts like an additional box of damage in both the Physical and Stun Condition Monitorsfor the purposes of determining penalties due to injuries. If one or both Condition Monitors are completely filled, the targeted individual stays conscious but is so wracked with pain that they cannot act. Once the spell is dropped, there is no ongoing effect from the pain.The base spell affects only an individual, but the Increase Area effect can be applied to make it an area spell (starting at 2m radius for +1 DV).
spell.analyze_device.desc=Sure, you know what a commlink looks like, but that doesn’t mean you can identify the function of the weird black box with a single input jack. And Ghost help you with a machine from the ’50s or something. Analyze Device provides information about the unknown device, based on the number of net hits (the device’s Object Resistance is used in the Opposed Test). The first time a character tries to use a device while sustaining this spell on it, they receive Edge equal to their net hits on this test (though the customary limit of gaining no more than 2 Edge in a combat round applies).
spell.analyze_magic.desc=Sometimes you want to know what magic does without going astral. Treat this spell as if you are assensing (see p. 159). The Opposed test uses 2 x total hits on the original skill test (Conjuring, Enchanting, or Sorcery) that created the magical effect being analyzed.
spell.analyze_truth.desc=The subject of the spell gains some sense if the target is telling the truth—or at least, if they believe they are. With at least 1 net hit, you gain this understanding. Note that the subject of the spell has to directly hear the statement being uttered to evaluate it—written statements, recordings, or audio/video transmissions cannot be used. Because mana, that’s why.
spell.anaphylaxis.desc=Every two hits on the Sorcery test increase the severity of the allergic reaction by 1 level (p. 75, SR6). If there is no pre-existing allergic reaction, the first two hits then create a mild allergic reaction (to the substance of the caster’s choice, selected on casting) as long as the spell is sustained. Once the spell is no longer sustained, the allergic reaction returns to normal levels—or just goes away, if no active allergens are present.
spell.animal_sense.desc=Do you want to know where your cat goes? Or what rat or pigeon tastes like? Your pet can share that with you. Do you want to experience flight like an eagle? Now you can by hitching a ride in the mind of your pet or another animal. Animal Sense allow the magician to select one sense (sight, hearing, smell, or taste) from a subject and with a Minor Action switch to perceiving that sense from the subject’s perspective instead of their own. Animal Sense only works with non-sentient animals (including paranormal ones). Any enhancement (such as thermographic vision, low-light vision, high frequency) that the subject has with that sense is included with the perception the caster gains. Animal Sense is resisted by the subject using Body + Willpower, but the subject does not have a conscious notion of the spell taking effect. Astral, virtual, and augmented reality perception cannot be channeled through these spells.
spell.animate_metal.desc=A chunk of material of the affected type comes to life, moving as commanded by the spellcaster. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance of the item/material being animated.The material can move according to its form, but generally it should not be faster than 5 meters per combat round unless it is a wheeled vehicle or something else with innate speed. The object is generally not capable of coordinated movements, so attacks from animated objects are slow and easily blocked. Still, it might be able to level a blow at a motionless or unwary target, doing 4P. Commanding the animated substance requires a Minor Action. If someone is trying to keep the object from following your commands, use Spellcasting net hits + 4 vs. opponent’s Body + Strength to see if the object is impeded from acting on the command.

spell.antidote=This spell sends mana coursing through the body to find and purge toxins. Roll a Sorcery + Magic test. Each hit reduces the toxin power by one. The mage may spend consecutive major actions to roll again without recasting. If the power hits zero, anyongoing effects of the toxin are eliminated.
spell.armor.desc=Your magic fills the body of the target, hardening it and making it better able to absorb damage. Roll Sorcery + Magic and add net hits to the target’s Defense Rating.
spell.astral_window.desc=Magic is hard to explain to the mundane, like color to someone blind. It can be hard to explain to another mage sometimes. With Astral Window, you can open up a window to the astral plane, visible even to the mundane. Then they would understand why magic is so nuts. Use their Perception skill as astral perception to see the “other side” within the sphere. The spell does not convey any knowledge to the viewer of what they are actually looking at (that requires the Arcane knowledge skill). The Increase Area effect can be applied to Astral Window to increase the diameter of the sphere by half a meter, up to the caster’s Magic rating in meters. With a Shift Area Minor Action, the sphere can be moved to a location within the magician’s line of sight. Any spell (mana or physical) or astral entity intercepted by or crossing through an Astral Window becomes visible from the material plane.
spell.babble.desc=Spell is cast between the magician and a willing subject they touch. Multiple people can be connected to the same hidden conversation; each additional person increases the spell’s Drain by 1. Any Perception test that doesn’t exceed the threshold of the spell’s hits only allows the listener to hear some trivial conversation unrelated to the actual conversation. Babble works against living entities.
spell.bane.desc=When casting these spells, add 1 wild die (p. 48, SR6). Slay is equivalent to Powerbolt in its results. Bane is equivalent to Manabolt in its results. These spells target one specific type of sentient creature (naga, centaur, sasquatch, etc.), spirit type (insect, earth, fire, etc.), or metatype (elf, dwarf, ork, troll, or human). These spells can be learned more than once, each time selecting a different target. If the target is not of the correct type, the spell has no effect. Subjects on the astral plane can only be targeted by Bane Slay and Bane are not only classified as 5M weapons, but they carry additional penalties as they target specific metatypes or sentient species. These penalties, depending on jurisdiction, can result in a death sentence. varying legal protections. I’ll connect you, for a small finder’s fee.
spell.blast.desc=A tricky little spell—the magic doesn’t hit the target, but it shapes the air to make the blow. The power of wind to shape rock formations is demonstrated solidly on the head of the target
spell.borrow_sense.desc=Literally see through the eyes of a CEO or listen in on their privileged conversations—at least, until a corp mage traces the spell back to you. Borrow Sense allow the magician to select one sense (sight, hearing, smell, or taste) from a subject and with a Minor Action switch to perceiving that sense from the subject’s perspective instead of their own. Any enhancement (such as thermographic vision, low-light vision, high frequency) that the subject has with that sense is included with the perception the caster gains. Borrow Sense is resisted by the subject using Body + Willpower, but the subject does not have a conscious notion of the spell taking effect. Astral, virtual, and augmented reality perception cannot be channeled through these spells.
spell.catalog.desc=The spell allows the caster to be hyper-aware of an object or area. The Observe in Detail Action becomes a Minor Action while the spell is sustained and used for the object The spell allow for extra details to be learned with Observe in Detail. Each net hit provides one type of detail that can be learned. While the Catalog spell is sustained, the magician can spend a Minor Action to view any point in the area of the spell from any perspective. The caster gains a point of Edge against any surprise tests within the area or attacks against invisible targets, as Catalog gives the caster a variety of details other than sight.
spell.catfall.desc=Gravity can be a harsh mistress. With Catfall, you can dance a little longer with her without crashing too badly at the end. Catfall reduces acceleration due to gravity, so the subject experiences the force of a much shorter fall. Each net hit equals 3 additional meters of safe falling, cumulative with the basic 3 meters of safety anyone gets (p. 113, SR6). The subject gains 1 point of situational Edge that can be used on Athletics or Damage Resistance tests related to the fall.
spell.chaff.desc=The spell is opposed by Willpower + Logic. It can be sustained up to 1 Combat Round for each net hit. With a successful casting of the spell, Chaff makes 1 point of Matrix noise in the affected area for each net hit on the Spellcasting test. Any wireless signals passing through the designated area are affected.
spell.chaos.desc=Confusion hits the target with a swirl of imagesand emotions that leave them disoriented and,well, confused. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower+ Logic; the target gains the Confused (#) status,with the number equaling the net hits on the test.The target experiences a dice pool penalty equalto that number on all tests besides Damage Resistancetests.Chaos has the same effect, except it also affectscameras, microphones, and other forms of technology.The base spell affects only an individual, but theIncrease Area effect can be applied to make it anarea spell (starting with a 2m radius). When it is anarea spell, the Shift Area effect can be used.
spell.clairaudience.desc=The person on whom this is cast gains the ability to hear distant sounds. The subject may select and move the spot; the size of the spot is determined by normal area-of-effect rules and can be adjusted with Increase Area and moved with Shift Area. The subject can only hear sounds in the target area while this spell is in effect (as opposed to sounds near them), and any hearing augmentations they have do not have any effect.  Shift Area.The subject can only hear sounds in the target areawhile this spell is in effect (as opposed to soundsnear them), and any hearing augmentations theyhave do not have any effect.
spell.clairvoyance.desc=Like Clairaudience, but with visuals instead of sound, so: The person on whom this is cast gains the ability to see distant sights. The subject may select and move the spot; the size of the spot is determined by normal area-of-effect rules and canbe adjusted with Increase Area and can be moved with Shift Area. The subject can only see visuals in the target area while this spell is in effect (as opposed to sights near them), and any visual augmentations they have do not have any effect.
spell.cleansing_heal.desc=This spell has the same healing effect as the Heal spell (roll Sorcery + Magic [5 – Essence], heal1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow damage pernet hit). In addition, this variant of the spell addsa cleansing element that eliminates the Corroded status on the targeted individual. Injuries can only be affected once by any healing spell.
spell.clout.desc=A tricky little spell—the magic doesn’t hit the target, but it shapes the air to make the blow. The power of wind to shape rock formations is demonstrated solidly on the head of the target
spell.combat_sense.desc=The subject gets a heightened awareness of possible dangers and the ability to react to them faster.Net hits on the Spellcasting test are added to the subject’s Defense Rating and dice pool for Surprise tests (see p. 108) as long as the spell is sustained.
spell.confusion.desc=Confusion hits the target with a swirl of images and emotions that leave them disoriented and,well, confused. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower+ Logic; the target gains the Confused (#) status,with the number equaling the net hits on the test.The target experiences a dice pool penalty equalto that number on all tests besides Damage Resistancetests.
spell.control_actions.desc=The spellcaster acts as master puppeteer, taking control of another person and making them dance to their tune. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower + Logic; net hits give the maximum duration of the spell in minutes. The target is aware of what is happening to them but can do little about it. The caster uses the same actions to command the individual as the action they are telling them to take, so that having them move is a Minor Action, but having them attack is a Major Action. This spell can be made into an area spell by using the Increase Area adjustment. Once the spell is cast, the effect stays with individuals who did not resist the spell, even if they move out of the initial area.
spell.control_thoughts.desc=Similar to Control Actions but more insidious, this puts the spellcaster inside the head of the target, making them think what the spellcaster wants them to. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower + Logic; net hits give the maximum duration of the spell in minutes. Unlike Control Actions, the target’s awareness of Control Thoughts being used on them is uncertain. The closer the thoughts are to the target’s normal thoughts, the less likely they are to notice the intrusion. At the gamemaster’s discretion, they can have the target make a Logic + Intuition test after the spell wears off to recognize the spell’s effect on them with a threshold based on how different from normal their thoughts were made to be. While the spellcaster plays a powerful role in shaping the individual’s thoughts, certain instincts are very difficult to override. Thoughts like “I should jump off this building” or “I should attack my best friend/spouse/partner” are generally going to be resisted. With thoughts such as these, the gamemaster can have the target roll another Willpower + Logic test to resist the suggestion, and they may gain Edge before the test if the thought is too far outside their normal thought process or if it violates their basic instincts.
spell.cooling_heal.desc=This spell has the same healing effect as the Heal spell (roll Sorcery + Magic [5 – Essence], heal1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow damage pernet hit. In addition, this variant of the spell adds acooling element that eliminates the Burning status on the targeted individual. Injuries can only be affected once by any healing spell.
spell.corrode.desc=These spells must include an object as part of the spell formula (Firearm, Commlink, Armor, etc.). The object chosen can either be narrow or broad. These spells can be learned multiple times, each with a new object. Gain +1 Edge when casting the spell if the object is narrow rather than broad (e.g., Heavy Pistol instead of Firearm) Direct and Indirect Area Effect Spells target all objects that meet the criteria and are visible to the magician.
spell.darkness.desc=These spells are two sides of the same coin, changing the light level of your environment to suit you. For each net hit, you can raise (using Light) or lower (using Darkness) the light level of the surrounding area, which may help gain when it comes to determing Edge based on Environment and Visibility (p. 118). These are area spells, and they can be adjusted using Increase Area and Shift Area.
spell.death_touch.desc=Essential spellcasting, shaping mana to crack skulls. Who can argue with this purity? These spells target living organisms and channel magical energy directly, causing massive cellular die off. Damage effects are similar to radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but faster and without the continuing effects. But still, ick.
spell.decrease_attribute.desc=The touch of the mage weakens, slows, or stupefiesthe target, temporarily lowering one of their attributes (to a minimum of 1). The caster decide swhich attribute to target before casting the spell.The caster rolls a Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower+ targeted attribute. They can select how many net hits they actually apply to the target at a rate of 1 point of decrease per net hit; for each net hit applied beyond the first, the Drain Value of the spell increases by 1. The spell cannot affect Edge, Essence,Magic, or Resonance.
spell.demolish.desc=These spells must include an object as part of the spell formula (Firearm, Commlink, Armor, etc.). The object chosen can either be narrow or broad. These spells can be learned multiple times, each with a new object. Gain +1 Edge when casting the spell if the object is narrow rather than broad (e.g., Heavy Pistol instead of Firearm) Direct and Indirect Area Effect Spells target all objects that meet the criteria and are visible to the magician.
spell.detect_enemies.desc=This spell lets the subject know if anyone within the sense’s range has hostile intentions toward them. It only works on people—not things, and it only detects people who have hostility specifically to the subject, not generalized anger at all metahumanity(if it did, everyone in the barrens would light up). Great for detecting ambushes!
spell.detect_life.desc=Are there people hiding in that pile of rubble? Or in the forest? This spell will point them out for you. Despite its broad-sounding name, it does not detect every living thing, but rather focuses on sentient beings.
spell.detect_magic.desc=No one wants to sort through an entire landfill to find the magic ring sitting amid all the trash,but sometimes that’s the job. Which is why an enterprising mage developed this spell, which alerts the caster to any forms of active magic within the sense’s range. This includes foci, reagents, activespells, wards, alchemical preparations, spirits, and active rituals, but does not include Awakened people,critters, astral signatures, alchemical preparations that have been triggered or lost their potency,or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.
spell.diagnose.desc=After casting the spell, consult the Diagnose results table. Results learned by the magician are inclusive, up to the hits cast by the spell. If the magician got 3 hits, they get the results from 1, 2, and 3 hits. Once the Diagnose spell is cast on an individual, they cannot have it cast on them again for twenty-four hours. The use of Diagnose adds +1 Edge to the magician’s Biotech skill test when used on the subject within twenty-four hours. A magician may choose to add 1 wild die to their Heal or Treat spell when used on the subject within twenty-four hours of casting the Diagnose spell on them.
spell.disquiet.desc=Disquiet affects only animals. Disquiet spell may be able to help. Any target that crosses the threshold of the spell area will start to feel nervousness and a sense of dread—enough that they’ll want to never darken your doorstep again. Disquiet mystically broadcasts feelings of imminent danger, fear, and unease to any animal who enters the area affected by the spell. Targets simultaneously feel chilled and nervous. Their hackles rise, and they feel slightly panicked. Any target who fails to resist the spell with Logic + Intuition gains the Frightened status (p. 52, SR6) while within the area affected by the spell. If net hits exceed the Willpower of the affected animal, that animal gains the Panicked status (p. 52, SR6) in addition to Frightened, and they must flee the area. Once outside of the spell’s area, the Frightened/ Panicked statuses go away after (caster’s Magic rating) minutes. If Disquiet is cast within a magic lodge, and 6 Karma is spent, then the spell is sustained until the lodge is removed, the caster cancels the spell, or someone actively counters it.
spell.disregard.desc=Disregard is a fascinating yet subtle mind-affecting spell. It manipulates and redirects attention, similar to the way people get so hyperfocused on a trideo show that they aren’t aware of anything happening around them. It alters both perception and memory, making designated individuals unimportant to those affected by the spell. For example, a police officer affected by Disregard could show a picture of a suspect to the actual suspect and ask if they’d seen themselves all without recognizing them. The suspect is not invisible—they’re simply not important to the officer and not relevant to the task at hand. When the spell ends, the officer won’t remember any details of their time under its influence. When a magician casts Disregard, they select one subject who will not be affected by the spell and will be ignored by those who are. They can select additional subjects; each one beyond the first increases the Drain Value by 1. The spellcaster rolls Sorcery + Magic; every target in the spell area (or who enters the area while the spell is sustained) resists with Willpower + Intuition. Those who fail to resist the spell ignore most things happening around them—nothing seems to matter. A guard on duty, for example, might simply wave at the subjects, or even be absent-mindedly friendly toward them, but not stop them from walking by. Targets affected by the spell have difficulty remembering details from the time they were under its influence. Net hits become the threshold for memory tests when trying to remember specific details (p. 67, SR6). The spell can be broken for targets if: • Someone directly attempts to harm an affected person. Self-preservation automatically breaks this spell. • Someone moving through the spell area glitches or critically glitches on a test. That could cause them to do something weird and noticeable enough that it can’t be ignored. • A sudden change in the environment (fire, gunfire, fire and gunfire, alarms) gives targets a second chance to resist the spell. They gain a point of Edge to use on this roll. • Interference with a target’s job allows them to resist the spell again. This could mean runners attempting to open a door that a guard is trying to keep closed or stealing a car from a garage a valet is watching. The gamemaster decides how much interference justifies to a re-roll.
spell.disrupt.desc=These spells can provoke feelings of inadequacy in others.\nThese spells can be learned as general (affecting all foci), or for a specific focus type (Enchanting, Metamagic, Power, Qi, Spell, Spirit, or Weapon).\nThe spell formulas are highly specialized to work with the particulars of foci. Other spells with astral or mana effects cannot interact with foci in the same way as these spells; conversely, these spells cannot interact with other astral forms besides those of foci.\nIf learned for a specific focus type, gain +1 Edge when casting the spell.\nThese spells can be learned more than once, choosing a different focus type each time.\nEach net hit on the Sorcery test does 1 box of temporary damage to the focus. While damaged, the focus is inactive and cannot be used. The damage heals at the end of each combat round at a rate of one box per round. It has a condition monitor equal to (rating x 2); filling the monitor means no more damage can be inflicted on the focus, but it does not disenchant or otherwise break the focus.
spell.double_image.desc=Confuse your enemy by splitting a party of one! Double Image creates a realistic illusionary duplicate of a touched subject that moves just like them. Targets who fail to see through the illusion will not be able to tell them apart! Now go to the party with your magical plus-one. Double Image can only be used once per person. You can cast Double Image multiple times, but each time it must be for a different person. The spell is resisted by Willpower + Intuition. Magicians can use a Minor Action to adjust the Double Image to keep it from breaking or help it function strategically. While the subject and double image are moving parallel to each other, the subject gains 1 Edge when they both attack the same target. The illusion will only act or react as the caster commands. If someone tries to tackle it or hit it, they move right through it, which reveals the illusion. This can happen on a melee attack that would have hit (on a melee attack, the illusion uses the caster’s Reaction + Intuition to avoid the attack, but it has no Defense Rating, so the attacker always gets Edge). Most firearm or missile attacks just look like they miss the illusion. The illusion runs right through grenade explosions, revealing its unreal nature. If someone is trying to chase the subject while the double image is moving in a different direction and they fail a Perception test (made using spell net hits as a threshold), then that person chases the illusion. Every (caster’s Magic rating x 10) meters, the pursuer can make another Perception test to see if they see discrepancies in the illusion. The caster controls the movements of the illusion. If the illusion inadvertently runs through a solid physical object, the chaser gets +5 dice on their test to perceive the illusion (they might not have seen what happened or might not trust what they thought they saw). Running through multiple objects in a single Combat Round adds five more dice per item (as the dice pool becomes higher, characters should feel free to buy hits on the test, as per the rules on p. 36, SR6). Once the illusion is out of the caster’s sight, it runs in a straight line for two hundred more meters, then disappears.
spell.dream.desc=The target must be asleep or rendered unconscious for the spell to work., but they still resist the spell with Willpower + Logic. Dreams allows the magician to craft a dream (including visuals, sounds, emotions, etc.) and transmit it to a sleeping target. Net hits determine complexity and details. Dreams do not cause actual harm to the target. Subject will remember the dream vividly but not necessarily that it was implanted. To use the spell more aggressively, if the spellcaster achieves 5 net hits, they can disrupt the subject’s rest period for the day, including any attempts at natural healing (p. 120, SR6) with an unshakable nightmare. That means a test to heal Physical damage cannot be made that day.
spell.ectomagic_pulse.desc=These spells can provoke feelings of inadequacy in others.\nThese spells can be learned as general (affecting all foci), or for a specific focus type (Enchanting, Metamagic, Power, Qi, Spell, Spirit, or Weapon).\nThe spell formulas are highly specialized to work with the particulars of foci. Other spells with astral or mana effects cannot interact with foci in the same way as these spells; conversely, these spells cannot interact with other astral forms besides those of foci.\nIf learned for a specific focus type, gain +1 Edge when casting the spell.\nThese spells can be learned more than once, choosing a different focus type each time.\nEach net hit on the Sorcery test does 1 box of temporary damage to the focus. While damaged, the focus is inactive and cannot be used. The damage heals at the end of each combat round at a rate of one box per round. It has a condition monitor equal to (rating x 2); filling the monitor means no more damage can be inflicted on the focus, but it does not disenchant or otherwise break the focus.
spell.elemental_armor.desc=Your magic fills the body of the target, hardening it and making it better able to absorb damage. Roll Sorcery + Magic and add net hits to the target’s Defense Rating., it also provides an added bonus. When casting the spell, you choose one element to protect the target from. Depending on the choice, the target cannot acquire certain statuses, as listed in the Elemental Protection table. They still may be damaged by a weapon or spell that does the type of damage from which you are protected—for example, if you have cooling armor, you still may be damaged by a Fireball blast if the initial attack roll is successful and you do not soak all the damage, but you would not gain the Burning status afterward.
spell.ephedrine.desc=Every two hits on the Sorcery test decrease the severity of the allergic reaction by 1 level (p. 75, SR6). Once the spell is no longer sustained, the allergic reaction returns to normal levels—or just goes away, if no active allergens are present. Ephedrine must be sustained until the worst of the reaction has passed or until mundane medicine is applied. Otherwise, the allergy returns.
spell.eyes_of_the_pack.desc=Become your own SimStar without the technology. Share your POV with friends and family as you tour famous locations like the Needle, or participate Eyes of the Pack allow the magician to select one sense (sight, hearing, smell, or taste) from a subject and with a Minor Action switch to perceiving that sense from the subject’s perspective instead of their own. Any enhancement (such as thermographic vision, low-light vision, high frequency) that the subject has with that sense is included with the perception the caster gains. Any enhancement (such as thermographic vision, low-light vision, high frequency) that the subject has with that sense is included with the perception the caster gains. Astral, virtual, and augmented reality perception cannot be channeled through these spells. Eyes of the Pack requires willing subjects. Increase drain by 1 for every animal connected after the first (with a maximum number of subjects equal to the caster’s Magic rating). While sustained, each subject can spend a Minor Action to change their perception to any other subject connected by this spell.
spell.false_impression.desc=This spell cannot create a false aura; they can only change or hide an existing aura. Any Assensing, Astral Perception test, or Astral Window spell that doesn’t exceed the hits of this spell see what the spell caster intended for them to see. If the Astral or Sorcery tests exceeds those of the False Impression spell, then the tester recognizes there is a masking spell, but they can only get the real information based on the difference between their hits and those on the False Impression spell.
spell.fashion.desc=When going from combat to social event, or maybe when you forgot to send your suit to the dry cleaner, this spell is the life-saver you need. Are you wearing the same outfit as the hostess? Fashion it! Is a tie required at a formal event? Fashion it! This spell can restore fabric to a just-like-new state, removing wrinkles and stains (even blood and sweat!) and mending small rips and tears. But that’s not all. A true artist with this spell can adjust the cut, color, pattern, and fit of any outfit to suit their needs. Free up that closet space and rent it out as a small room, because one outfit and your imagination is all you’ll ever need! Weight and volume of material of the clothing cannot change. A jumpsuit can’t be converted into a bikini or vice versa. After rolling Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance (6 for most clothing), consult Fashion Results Table. NET HITS RESULT 1 The tint of the color can change (e.g., dark blue to light blue, but not blue to green); clothes are unwrinkled; small rips and tears are mended. Hair and dander are removed. 2 Adjustments to the fit of the clothing can be made, but nothing drastic about the nature of the clothes (for example, pants are still pants); color can change slightly (e.g., blue to green or purple, but not red); stains are removed. 3 A full spectrum of color can be manipulated. Simple geometric patterns and designs can be added, but nothing as elaborate as corporate logos or name tags. Modifications such as the addition or removal of pockets or pants to a skirt can be done. Heavy damage such as from bullets and blades is repaired. 4+ Clothing can be changed with enough specificity to mimic a uniform, provided enough material is available. Color changes can help mimic missing accessories such as buttons, labels, ties, badges, ribbons, etc. These changes, however, are only convincing at a distance if the physical accessories are not present. The closer a target gets to the subject, the more likely they will notice the actual accessories are missing (a gamemaster would call for a Perception test to see if the person notices). Patterns and designs on clothing can be as intricate as the magician desires. Any armor with a Defense Rating higher than 3 resists the changes to Fashion more than usual. Apply (Defense Rating – 3) as a threshold when casting the spell, then consult the table using the net hits
spell.fast.desc=Successful casting of the spell removes the feeling of hunger and thirst for twenty-four hours. Each additional hit reduces the Fatigued status caused by starvation and thirst by one level (see below). Fast does not alleviate the need for food and water.
spell.fireball.desc=A classic. When you think of hurting people with magic, the first thing that comes to mind is making fire explode in their faces. These are the spells that’ll get that done. Flamestrike hits individuals, Fireball is area effect. Both spells do Fire elemental damage (p. 110) and impose the Burning status (p. 51) with a rating equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test.
spell.flamestrike.desc=A classic. When you think of hurting people with magic, the first thing that comes to mind is making fire explode in their faces. These are the spells that’ll get that done. Flamestrike hits individuals, Fireball is area effect. Both spells do Fire elemental damage (p. 110) and impose the Burning status (p. 51) with a rating equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test.
spell.fling.desc=If you ever thought, “If I had magic powers, I definitely would catapult objects into the sky, only without a catapult,” then you’re our sort of person, and this spell is for you. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance. For each net hit, you can fling half a kilogram of material into the air, and net hits also act as a threshold for a Reaction + Intuition (Magic – 2), Extreme: —, and it does Stun damage equal to kilograms of weight, rounded up.
spell.focus_burst.desc=Foci can be powerful aids for magicians, but who hasn’t found themselves wanting to eke out a little more power from them every now and then? With Focus Burst, you can get a little more out of your focus or give someone else a boost. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. focus Force x 2. If you get any net hits, increase the effective rating of the focus by 1 for (net hits) minutes. A critical glitch on the Spellcasting test permanently reduces the Force of the focus by 2.
spell.foreboding.desc=Foreboding affects metahumans and sentient beings.Foreboding mystically broadcasts feelings of imminent danger, fear, and unease to any living being who enters the area affected by the spell. Targets simultaneously feel chilled and nervous. Their hackles rise, and they feel slightly panicked. Any target who fails to resist the spell with Logic + Intuition gains the Frightened status (p. 52, SR6) while within the area affected by thespell. If net hits exceed the Willpower of the affected individual, that individual gains the Panicked status (p. 52, SR6) in addition to Frightened, and they must flee the area. Once outside of the spell’s area, the Frightened/ Panicked statuses go away after (caster’s Magic rating) minutes. If Foreboding is cast within a magic lodge, and 6 Karma is spent, then the spell is sustained until the lodge is removed, the caster cancels the spell, or someone actively counters it.
spell.gecko_crawl.desc=When you are stuck in a deep hole, what can you do? If flight is not one of your normal modes of transportation, then hopefully you have purchased Gecko Crawl. Gecko Crawl empowers the subject’s hands and feet with ultra-reliable gecko sticky magic that allows climbing along vertical surfaces. Subject gets +1 Edge when making Climbing tests. While this spell is sustained, the base threshold for climbing tests is reduced to zero (see p. 93, SR6). The subject may move along a ceiling at their normal climbing rate (so long as the ceiling can hold them). If the Structure rating (p. 113, SR6) is less than the Body of the subject, then the ceiling buckles or breaks under the weight of the subject, and Gecko Crawl fails to keep the subject connected.
spell.glue.desc=Ran out of duct tape and zip ties? No worries! With Glue, any surface will do to keep a subject from escaping. Subject must be in contact with the object to be adhered when the spell is cast. Subject must be in contact with the object to be adhered when the spell is cast. Glue is opposed by Object Resistance (p. 129, SR6) or Reaction + Intuition. Drain is one-half the Structure rating (p. 113, SR6) of the object, rounded up (minimum 2). If there is no structure rating, substitute object resistance. If two objects are glued together, the drain is the higher Structure or Object Resistance rating of the two. Individuals glued to a structure gain the Immobilized status (p. 52, SR6) until freed. If the spell is successful, pulling the two surfaces apart requires an Opposed test between the spell’s hits + caster’s Magic rating and the separator’s Strength + Body. If Sorcery test net hits exceed the Structure or Body of the object/subject, then physical damage occurs if the objects are separated. The objects must resist Sorcery test net hits in damage as if the spell were a direct combat spell when they are successfully pulled apart.
spell.heal.desc=Shadowrunning comes with bumps, bruises, andbullet wounds, and magic is perhaps the quickestand most effective way to repair it. When casting this spell, roll Sorcery + Magic with a threshold of (5 – Essence). Heal 1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflowdamage per net hit. Injuries can only be affected onceby any Heal spell (including Cleansing Heal, CoolingHeal, and Warming Heal).
spell.healthy_glow.desc=While the effects of Healthy Glow are permanent, hard living (though in the Sixth World, just going outside is considered “hard living”) and natural aging will, over time, reintroduce what the spell hid. With a successful casting of the spell, the subject appears physically cleaner and healthier for up to one hour per net hit, though exposure to harsh elements can reduce this. This means they gain 1 Edge for Social tests thanks to their appearance. Healthy Glow brightens the physical appearance of the subject (improves circulation, whitens teeth, reduces wrinkles, blemishes, split ends, bad breath) and improves general health (bruising fades, tan lines blend, and cuts/ scars look more superficial). Additionally, with a successful casting of the spell, any first aid or healing tests performed on the character gain 1 Edge to spend on that test. This bonus effect is only temporary, lasting (net hits) hours after casting the spell. The spell can only be used once every twenty-four hours on a particular subject.
spell.hellblast.desc=A classic. When you think of hurting people with magic, the first thing that comes to mind is making fire explode in their faces.

spell.hose.desc=Targets of the spell gain the Wet status (p. 53, SR6). If successful, each target is pushed back 1 meter away from the caster or the center of the spell. If net hits exceed the Body of the target, then the target is knocked Prone (p. 53, SR6). Any additional net hits (resisted by the target rolling their Body) become the number of meters that the target is pushed back in addition to the first meter These spells are not recommended for drinking purposes for pressure reasons. Water temperature may vary, though most subjects say it’s slightly cooler than room temperature.
spell.hot_potato.desc=The magicin rolls Sorcery + Willpower vs. Willpower + Intuition. If the target fails to resist the illusion, they must immediately use a Drop Object Minor Action (p. 41, SR6) to drop whatever they are holding, believing that it is causing them pain.
spell.hush.desc=Silence descends on that target, making them unableto make a noise even if they tried. This can begreat for people trying to sneak by a target, or a goodway to throw disruption among people dependingon vocal communication. Hush gives targets the Silent(#) status (see p. 53), with the number equalingthe net hits on the Sorcery + Magic test. That numberacts as a threshold for any attempts to hear thecharacter.
spell.ice_sheet.desc=This spell creates a flat sheet of ice that covers a number of square meters equal to the caster’s Magic rating multiplied by Sorcery test hits. The number of hits also relates to the thickness of the ice. At 5+ hits, the ice is thick enough that stairs become inclines. Ice Sheet can also be used to make walls slick and smooth for purposes of climbing (p. 93, SR6) or frost over windows to obscure line of sight. Anyone on the ice gains the Off-Balance status (p. 106, Firing Squad). Off-Balance remains in place every combat round until the subject gets off the ice. Anyone driving over the ice sheet must make a Handling test or lose control of their vehicle. Once the spell has stopped being sustained, the ice instantly effervesces into the aether.
spell.ice_spear.desc=When every corp security goon you run into starts wearing flame-retardant underwear, it’s time to throw a changeup at them and hit them with the other temperature extreme. These spells blast targets with freezing cold, doing Cold elemental damage (p. 110) along with the normal damage and imposing the Chilled status (p. 51) for a number of combat rounds equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test. 
spell.ice_storm.desc=When every corp security goon you run into starts wearing flame-retardant underwear, it’s time to throw a changeup at them and hit them with the other temperature extreme. These spells blast targets with freezing cold, doing Cold elemental damage (p. 110) along with the normal damage and imposing the Chilled status (p. 51) for a number of combat rounds equal to net hits on the Spellcasting test. 
spell.icy_veins.desc=Not recommended for walking on lava. Must target a willing subject. Target gains the Chilled status (p. 51, SR6). Target resists the Burning status (p. 51, SR6) in an amount equal to net hits on the Sorcery test. Target doesn’t show up on thermal sensors. This removes any attacker or defender environmental advantage over the subject if based on thermal vision
spell.improved_invisibility.desc=The target fades from view, becoming transparentso that they can move unnoticed. Invisibilitygives the targeted character the Invisible(#) status (p. 52), where the number after thestatus becomes the threshold on any tests to seethe character. The Invisible (Improved) spell givesthe Improved Invisibility (#) status, which is essentiallythe same but works against cameras andother technology as well as against living entities.
spell.increase_attribute.desc=The touch of the mage strengthens, speeds, or enlightens the target, temporarily raising one of their attributes. The caster decides which attribute to target before casting the spell. The caster rolls a Sorcery + Magic (5 – Essence) test. They can select how many net hits they actually apply to the target to increase the selected attribute, at a rate of 1 point of increase per net hit (maximum bonus +4); for each net hit applied beyond the first, the Drain Value of the spell increases by 1. The spell cannot affect Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance.
spell.increase_reflexes.desc=The reaction time and speed of the target increase,making them better able to anticipate and respond to others. The caster rolls a Sorcery+ Magic (5 – Essence) test. They can select howmany net hits they actually apply to the target toincrease both their Reaction score and the number of Initiative Dice, at a rate of 1 point of increase and 1 Initiative Die per net hit; for each net hit applied beyond the first, the Drain Value of the spell increases by 1.
spell.invisibility.desc=The target fades from view, becoming transparentso that they can move unnoticed. Invisibilitygives the targeted character the Invisible(#) status (p. 52), where the number after thestatus becomes the threshold on any tests to seethe character.
spell.knockout.desc=Sometimes you take a little off the heater to catch the other guy off-balance. These spells channel mana in a way that hurts, but only to stun.
spell.levitate.desc=It may not be exactly the same as flight, but hey, it’s defying gravity, and it’s a blast. Roll Sorcery + Magic; for each hit, you can levitate 50 kilos worth of material or people. If it’s the latter and the person is not particularly interested in being levitated, they can make a Body + Strength test, with each hit reducing your effective hits by 1. The target has to stay in sight if you want them to stay in the air; the minute they’re out of sight, they’ll be earthward bound. That, along with a sense of caution about raising someone too high when spells can be interrupted, tends to put a cap on how high people are sent up into the air with this spell. The target does not have to hover. They can be moved by the caster at a rate of (caster’s Magic rating) meters per turn. Moving them requires a Minor Action.
spell.light.desc=These spells are two sides of the same coin, changing the light level of your environment to suit you. For each net hit, you can raise (using Light) or lower (using Darkness) the light level of the surrounding area, which may help gain when it comes to determing Edge based on Environment and Visibility (p. 118). These are area spells, and they can be adjusted using Increase Area and Shift Area.
spell.lightning_ball.desc=It’s what deities from Zeus to Thor use tosmite those who have it coming, which means it should be good enough for you, too. Lightning Bolt hits a single target with electricity, while Lightning Ball is area effect. Both spells do Electricity elemental damage (p. 109), imposingthe Zapped status (p. 53) for a number of turns equal to net hits.

spell.lokis_musical_number.desc=Subjects in the area of the spell can be willing or unwilling participants. Unwilling participants can resist the spell with Willpower + Magic. If successful, subjects have a low-level psychic connection with one another and the magician. Through this link, music can be heard by the subjects, and they gain mystical coordination of physical actions in time with the music. Unwilling subjects who failed to resist the spell cannot voluntarily leave the spell’s area of effect. The caster or a willing subject must spend a Major Action to make a Con (Performance) skill test every combat round or the spell breaks. If net hits exceed targets’ Willpower, the caster can use a Minor Action to direct those targets to make a Teamwork test. Their next Major Action must be an Assist action (p. 42, SR6). The Assist action becomes a Minor Action between willing subjects so long as they spend their Major Action with a Con (Performance) skill test; only 1 Assist action can be performed per person per Teamwork test. All of this only occurs while the spell is in effect.
spell.looking_glass.desc=Transparent aluminum? How about transparent concrete? Yes, folks, this spell changes the opacity of any material to a new magical translucence! It’s so clear, you’d swear it wasn’t even there. Looking Glass is opposed by Object Resistance (p. 129, SR6). Drain is one-half the Structure rating (p. 113, SR6) of the object, rounded up (minimum 2). Any object affected by Looking Glass allows for line of sight to objects or persons on the other side of the object. Looking Glass doesn’t provide any illumination—just transparency. Magic Fingers creates psychokinetic force with enough precision to mimic the movement of hands. The Magic Fingers spell does not fully replicate fine motor skills. Do not attempt watch repair, surgery, or bomb defusing with Magic Fingers. Within a one-meter-diameter sphere, the magician has a pair of invisible hands with which they can perform various actions. With a Shift Area Minor Action, the sphere can be moved to a location within the magician’s line of sight. When the hands attempt to do something, it uses the relevant skill rating of the caster combined with an attribute equal to the caster’s Sorcery test net hits. Edge cannot be gained or spent when performing an action through Magic Fingers.
spell.makeover.desc=Makeover requires a willing subject. After rolling the Sorcery test, consult the Makeover Results Table for results. Makeover can create a coating for certain individual surfaces such as hair and nails that lasts for (caster’s Magic rating) hours on a living subject. It can only be cast once every twenty-four hours on a particular subject. During this time, the material won’t chip, fade, or wash off. After this time, it will then wear off through normal day-to-day routine. Makeover cannot treat any medical conditions but can cover them up, provided the magician achieved enough hits (2 or more). While the spell is in effect, the subject can gain 1 Edge for social tests thanks to the changes in their appearance. than the other, I just think I have good fashion sense and just need help in case I forgot to shave, or I had garlic for lunch. the polymers can’t match.
spell.mana_barrier.desc=Want a spirit-free room? Want a way to enforce your bar’s “no foci” policy? Then a mana barrier is the way to go. This invisible wall (visible only on the astral) will let people and non-magical objects through with no noticeable effect, but spirits, foci, dual-natured beings, alchemical preparations, reagents, and spells can’t get through. Astrally projecting mages can’t get through, either (though they can always try to go around). Unless they fight their way through, which they sometimes do, but it’s good to make them struggle sometimes. To cast a mana barrier, roll Sorcery + Magic; (net hits + caster’s Magic) is the Structure rating of the astral wall you create. At the basic level, the spell creates a two-meterby-two-meter barrier. The Increase Area effect can be added to add up to two meters in length and width (but not depth) for each time the effect is chosen The barrier can be shaped as desired by the caster. For more information on mana barriers, see p. 161.
spell.mana_window.desc=Mana barriers are opaque on the astral plane (or when viewed with astral perception), so they block astral sight as well as spells and astral entities. This is in addition to preventing spells and astral entities from crossing. Mana Window only works for spells and astral perception. It does not remove the barrier or allow astral entities to cross through. Mana Window is opposed by a dice pool equal to the Structure rating of the barrier. If Mana Window achieves more hits, then the window appears on the barrier. The window is one meter in diameter; additional hits increase the transparency area by one meter, up to the caster’s Magic rating in meters.
spell.manaball.desc=WEssential spellcasting, shaping mana to crack skulls. Who can argue with this purity?These spells target living organisms and channel magical energy directly, causing massive cellular die off. Damage effects are similar to radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but faster and without the continuing effects. But still, ick. Manaball is affected by subconscious targeting, which impacts plants, insects, and other visible living creatures within the area. No discrimination. 
spell.manabolt.desc=Essential spellcasting, shaping mana to crack skulls. Who can argue with this purity?

spell.manascrape.desc=This spell cannot create a false aura; they can only change or hide an existing aura. Any Assensing, Astral Perception test, or Astral Window spell that doesn’t exceed the hits of this spell see what the spell caster intended for them to see. If the Astral or Sorcery tests exceeds those of the Manascape spell, then the tester recognizes there is a masking spell, but they can only get the real information based on the difference between their hits and those on the Manascape spell.
spell.mask.desc=Sometimes you don’t want to be seen; othertimes, you want to be seen as someone you arenot. Mask is for the latter. The spell changes thecritical characteristics of the person—their appearance,their sound, their scent, and so forth. RollSorcery + Magic and record the number of hits;those hits are used as a threshold when people tryto see through the illusion, which requires an Willpower+ Intuition test. Mask affects only living,sentient beings; Physical Mask affects cameras, microphones,and other technology.
spell.melt.desc=The spell must include an object as part of the spell formula (Firearm, Commlink, Armor, etc.). The object chosen can either be narrow or broad.\nThese spells can be learned multiple times, each with a new object. Gain +1 Edge when casting the spell if the object is narrow rather than broad (e.g., Heavy Pistol instead of Firearm)\nDirect and Indirect Area Effect Spells target all objects that meet the criteria and are visible to the magician.\nDamage Effects of Object targeting spells\n \u001bOBJECT\t\u001bEFFECT\nArmor\tDamage reduces the Defense Rating of armor.

If all Attack Ratings are reduced to 0 or less, the weapon is destroyed (not repairable).\nWall/Barrier\tDamage reduces the Structure Rating of the barrier. If the Structure Rating is reduced to 0, a one-half-meter hole is created in the structure.

If the Device Rating is reduced to 0, the device is destroyed (not repairable). If the device has a condition monitor, such as a deck, apply damage to the condition monitor instead.
spell.mind_probe.desc=The subject of this spell can dig into a target’s mind, seeing how many of their thoughts they can discern—while also attempting to sort what is true from the lies they tell themselves. Roll Sorcery +Magic vs. Willpower + Logic; net hits determine how much information the subject pulls out of the target’s head.\nNET HITS RESULT\r\n1–2 The subject can read the target’s surface thoughts only.\r\n3–4\r\nThe subject can find out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s recent memories (up to 72 hours). \r\n5+The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, gaining information the target may not even be consciously aware of, like psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories.
spell.mindlink.desc=Commlinks and text messaging? So passé. Just throw your thoughts into someone else’s mind for the ultimate in rapid communication! As long asyou get a hit on the Sorcery + Magic test, you have a link, and you can share mental communication in whatever form makes sense to you and subject of this spell. The caster and the subject must remain within range of each other for the link to continue functioning; if they move out of sense range and then come back into it, they can pick up the communication again, as long as the spell was continuously sustained.
spell.mob_mind.desc=Targets in the area of effect resist the spell with Willpower + Logic. If Mob Mind is successful, for every 2 net hits, the targets’ minds are adjusted from their current attitudes toward a subject chosen by the magician (including themselves) in the direction the magician wants. There are four basic attitude levels: Hostile, Dislike, Neutral, and Friendly. The caster can adjust the targets’ attitude toward a specific subject, or more than one if they got enough net hits. This new attitude can affect social Edge (p. 98, SR6) while the spell is active. The caster has no control over what actions the subjects take with their new mentality. If Mob Mind gain 5+ net hits, the caster can make a Con + Charisma vs. Intuition + Willpower test; if successful, the caster has created a grunt group (p. 114, SR6) to start a riot, bar fight, protest, etc
spell.mob_mood.desc=Targets in the area of effect resist the spell with Willpower + Logic. If Mob Mood is successful, the targets’ current feelings are adjusted by a new emotional state (happy, angry, sad, etc.). The more hits, the more intense the new emotional state. This can be disruptive to the subjects (applying a –1 dice pool penalty to tests involving active skills for every 2 net hits). Gamemasters can adjust the actual penalty when needed, such as reducing it when actions are based on the new emotion. The caster has no control over what actions the subjects take with their new mentality. If Mob Mood gain 5+ net hits, the caster can make a Con + Charisma vs. Intuition + Willpower test; if successful, the caster has created a grunt group (p. 114, SR6) to start a riot, bar fight, protest, etc Mob Mind

spell.napalm.desc=Napalm imposes the Burning status (p. 51, SR6) with a level equaling Sorcery test net hits. Fire Resistance is only half as effective against it (meaning it reduces the Burning status by up to half its rating, rounded up), unless the armor also has Chemical Seal (p. 267, SR6), in which case Fire Resistance functions as normal. Increase Area effect can be applied to Napalm, changing from single target to a two-meter area (and beyond, if you really love the smell of napalm in the morning).
spell.nutrition.desc=Nutrition provides the target with nourishment at a cellular level, allowing them to live off pure mana. Each hit prevents starvation and dehydration for twelve hours (with a maximum of three days) but doesn’t remove the feelings of hunger or thirst (see Fast spell above). For an existing starving subject, each hit reduces the level of fatigue by 1 caused by starvation (see Fast, p. 30, for information on food and fatigue) before applying hits to provide nourishment. Use of Nutrition beyond two weeks can lead to Fae Food Syndrome and the inability to take in solid food and drinks without serious digestive problems. Fae Food Syndrome must be treated by a medical professional; treatments tend to last two weeks.

With this spell, a mage can briefly amp up an electronic device’s power, making it run better and faster. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance. For each net hit, you can increase an attribute of the device (Device Rating, Attack, Data Processing, Firewall, or Sleaze) by 1. The caster can decide to not use some net hits if they want to reduce wear and tear on the device. This use of magic strains the device. After the spell is dropped, the device takes Matrix Damage equal to the net hits used, resisted by Firewall.
spell.oxygenate.desc=Oxygenate infuses the body directly with lifesaving, pure oxygen. No processing of earth’s dirty air needed. Each net hit provides an additional die on tests to resist damage from suffocation, strangulation, or other forms of oxygenation depravation. Each net hit reduces the Fatigued or Dazed status if the status is based on oxygen deprivation. While sustained, the subject is immune to inhalation vector attacks and drowning (if the subject remembers to hold his breath). Oxygenate requires a willing subject. Oxygenate provides 1 Edge on swimming or diving tests. That point must be used immediately or lost. Overuse of Oxygenate can cause lungs to atrophy. If the spell is used every day for a week or more, give the subject the Fatigued I status until they go without it for the same number of days.
spell.passenger.desc=Literally see through the eyes of a CEO or listen in on their privileged conversations—at least, until a corp mage traces the spell back to you. Passenger allows the magician to perceive all the senses of the subject, making it essentially a magical live simsense experience (minus the emotional package) Any enhancement (such as thermographic vision, low-light vision, high frequency) that the subject has with that sense is included with the perception the caster gains. Astral, virtual, and augmented reality perception cannot be channeled through these spells. Passenger is resisted by the subject using Body + Willpower, but the subject does not have a conscious notion of the spell taking effect.
spell.phantasm.desc=With this spell, the caster projects a particularimage into the area of effect (along withaccompanying sounds and smells). Maybe it’sthe image of an attacking dragon, or a peacefulgarden, or of a specific individual—whatever itis, it has to be something the caster has seen before,and the phantasm must stay in their line ofsight.

spell.phantomscape.desc=Change the appearance of your home or office with the illusory features and textures of Phantomscape. Why bring your friends over to your double-wide when it could look like a small keep, an English cottage complete with the scent of a blossoming garden and tea, or even a cabin in the woods (ominous background music optional). Phantomscape cannot support nor stop physical objects passing through the illusory items. Phantomscape has a slightly larger area of effect than normal and is a cube rather than a sphere; it starts at 20 cubic meters (about the size of a small room) and increases by 20 cubic meters with each Increase Area effect. It only affects background, inanimate objects—not items that are going to be touched and used. The magician’s Sorcery + Magic is opposed by the viewer’s Willpower + Intuition.
spell.physical_barrier.desc=Sometimes you want to keep magic away from you, and other times you want to keep absolutely everything you can away. Physical Barrier builds a wall where you want it to be, with a Structure rating equal to (Magic + hits on a Sorcery + Magic test). The base spell casts a barrier that is two meters by two meters, two centimeters thick. The Increase Area effect can be applied to add up to two meters in length and width (but not depth) for each time the effect is chosen. 
spell.physical_mask.desc=Sometimes you don’t want to be seen; other times, you want to be seen as someone you are not. Mask is for the latter. The spell changes the critical characteristics of the person—their appearance, their sound, their scent, and so forth.

Mask affects only living, sentient beings; Physical Mask affects cameras, microphones, and other technology.
spell.powerball.desc=A tricky little spell—the magic doesn’t hit the target, but it shapes the air to make the blow. The power of wind to shape rock formations is demonstrated solidly on the head of the target. The harsher version of Clout, Powerbolt smacks targets with Physical damage; Powerball does the same as an area effect.

spell.preserve.desc=Successful casting of the spell prevents organic material from natural mold and decay. Each hit puts the material in a state of suspended animation for six hours after casting, keeping the temperature, humidity, and so forth exactly as they were when the spell is cast. The spell can affect 1 cubic meter of material. The Increase Area effect can be increase the volume by half a cubic meter (up to half the caster’s Magic rating, rounded up, in cubic meters). For bodies, add half the Body attribute to the Drain of the spell instead of calculating volume. Each hit also counts as the protective rating against Chilled, Burning, or Corroded status as well as spell resistance to Rot. The spell doesn’t protect against physical damage. Any physical damage, disruption, or dispersal of the material breaks the spell.
spell.punch.desc=A tricky little spell—the magic doesn’t hit the target, but it shapes the air to make the blow. The power of wind to shape rock formations is demonstrated solidly on the head of the target

spell.rosebush.desc=Must target living, willing plants. Remember that carrots distrust wizards. They know what happened to bok choy. Hits accelerate growth. Each hit represents a week of growth or healing of boxes of damage done to the plant (if the plant has a condition monitor). In an offensive use of the Rosebush spell, any subjects moving through the area gain the Off-Balance status (p. 106, Firing Squad), as a massive burst of vegetation (weeds, vines, branches, whatever) inhibit any movement through the area. If Sorcery test hits exceed the subject’s Strength, then the subject also receives the Hobbled status (p. 52, SR6) while moving through the area. Plants are not animated after the initial casting of the spell. Strength of the plant is equal to onehalf the Magic rating of the caster, and it can be used as a threshold for escape tests.
spell.rot.desc=Rot breaks down organic material (plant, animal, bacteria, whatever), living or otherwise, into gooey material best suited for fertilizer. Hard organic material such as bones crumbles to bone meal (also good for plants). Used offensively, Rot can cripple a subject. Every two net hits (the spell is resisted with Willpower + Intuition) can be used to inflict a level of the Disabled status (up to level III), (p. 106, Firing Squad) or Fatigued status (up to level III; p. 52, SR6) as flesh and bone cease to connect or even exist. Damage from Rot cannot be cured by Heal spells. When not used offensively, the spell can affect half a cubic meter of material. The Increase Area effect can be applied to Rot to increase the volume by half a cubic meter (up to half the caster’s Magic rating, rounded up, in cubic meters). For bodies, increases the drain by one-half the Body (rounded down) of the target rather than calculating cubic meters of material. rot effectiveness # OF HITS EFFECT 1 Unusable for material link 2 Unusable for genetic testing (though hard organic material like bones and teeth still remain) 3 Unusable for identifying if it’s animal or vegetable; hard organics crumble; all materials unusable for forensics 4 It’s just goo (only inorganic material such as cybernetics remain intact)
spell.scrutinize.desc=The spell allows the caster to be hyper-aware of an object or area.

spell.shape_metal.desc=These spells give you the ability to make the selected material malleable—putty in your (mental) hands, essentially. You can shape the material as long as the spell is sustained; when the spell is dropped, the material retains whatever form you gave it.

spell.silence.desc=Silence descends on that target, making them unableto make a noise even if they tried. This can begreat for people trying to sneak by a target, or a goodway to throw disruption among people dependingon vocal communication. Hush gives targets the Silent(#) status (see p. 53), with the number equalingthe net hits on the Sorcery + Magic test. That numberacts as a threshold for any attempts to hear thecharacter. Silence acts the same, but it gives the Silent(Improved) (#) status, so that microphones and othertechnology also will not hear the targeted character.
spell.slay.desc=When casting these spells, add 1 wild die (p. 48, SR6). Slay is equivalent to Powerbolt in its results. Bane is equivalent to Manabolt in its results. These spells target one specific type of sentient creature (naga, centaur, sasquatch, etc.), spirit type (insect, earth, fire, etc.), or metatype (elf, dwarf, ork, troll, or human). These spells can be learned more than once, each time selecting a different target. If the target is not of the correct type, the spell has no effect. Subjects on the astral plane can only be targeted by Bane Slay and Bane are not only classified as 5M weapons, but they carry additional penalties as they target specific metatypes or sentient species. These penalties, depending on jurisdiction, can result in a death sentence. varying legal protections. I’ll connect you, for a small finder’s fee.
spell.sludge.desc=These spells must include an object as part of the spell formula (Firearm, Commlink, Armor, etc.). The object chosen can either be narrow or broad. These spells can be learned multiple times, each with a new object. Gain +1 Edge when casting the spell if the object is narrow rather than broad (e.g., Heavy Pistol instead of Firearm) Direct and Indirect Area Effect Spells target all objects that meet the criteria and are visible to the magician.
spell.stabilize.desc=This is the spell to use when someone is in Overflow damage and is sustaining an ongoing damaging effect or status. Roll Sorcery + Magic, with a thresholdof the number of Overflow boxes of damage thetarget has. Meeting the threshold means the target is stabilized , and all Overflow damage is removed. Thenet hits can only affect Overflow damage and cannotheal regular damage.
spell.sterilize.desc=Casting of spell renders all organic material unfit as a material link within the area of the spell. To prevent this spell from becoming harmful to complex life forms, it is designed not to work on anything but surfaces—thus, it cannot cleanse infected lungs, pathogens sealed in bottles, or other such things. If a Heal spell is cast within two hours in an area affected by a Sterilize spell, the caster gains 1 Edge for use on the casting.
spell.strengthen_wall.desc=Whether you’re trying to solidify a wall that your opponents are trying to breach or cut down the noise from the people that are roller skating or something in the apartment above yours, making an existing wall a little stronger can be useful. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance for the wall you are trying to affect; net hits increase the Structure rating by 1 per net hit. You can affect four square meters of wall with the base version of this spell; using the Increase Area effect increases this by four square meters per point of DV added. The Shift Area effect can be used for this spell.
spell.stunball.desc=Sometimes you take a little off the heater to catch the other guy off-balance. These spells channel mana in a way that hurts, but only to stun.

spell.thieves_cant .desc=Spell is cast between the magician and a willing subject they touch. Multiple people can be connected to the same hidden conversation; each additional person increases the spell’s Drain by 1. Any Perception test that doesn’t exceed the threshold of the spell’s hits only allows the listener to hear some trivial conversation unrelated to the actual conversation. Thieves’ Cant works against cameras and other technology as well as against living entities
spell.thunder.desc=A big, loud distraction can be useful, and that’s what this spell offers. By casting it, the magician shapes sound wages into a noise of their choice—it might sound like the spell’s namesake, or the roar of rush-hour traffic, or the distant babble of shouted voices, or some other such din. The basic area affected by the spell is a two-meter-radius sphere; this can be expanded with the Increase Area effect. For each hit on the Sorcery + Magic test, the noise continues for 1 combat round after the spell is dropped by the caster. Net hits serve as a negative dice pool modifier on those trying to hear other noises in the area.
spell.thunderstruck.desc=Spell damage is the same as Clout (p. 133, SR6), with additional effects listed below. \nIf net hits of the spell are greater than the Body of the target, the target gains the Dazed status for 1 Combat Round.\nNoise of the spell is centered on the target. The target and any other living creatures within two-meter radius must resist the spell or gain the Deafened status for (caster’s Magic rating) minutes.\nEvery two net hits increases the Deafened level by 1, up to Deafened III.\nThe Increase Area effect can be applied to Thunderstruck’s noise, but the Clout damage only affects a single target.\nNot legal in Texas (CAS).
spell.translate.desc=With this spell, you don’t have to worry about having the correct linguasoft or whether the results successfully convey the intended meaning. When someone speaks in their native tongue, you hear the words in your own language. It’s like a weirdly dubbed foreign film. Translate creates a low-level telepathic connection between the subject and a specific target within sense range (see p. 134, SR6). An unwilling target can resist with Body + Willpower. Translate is good for casual conversation but not diplomatic negotiations. Edge cannot be gained or spent when performing any social skill test through translate. Both subjects must be able to see and hear each other for the spell to be effective. Translate may be used to communicate with any sapient species that uses language (such as sasquatch or merrow) but may not be used to communicate with non-sapient animals. The hits from the spell determine the quality of the translation; with relatively few net hits, the gamemaster can introduce elements of uncertainty into what the caster is hearing or what others hear them say translation quality NUMBER OF HITS CONVERSATION QUALITY 0 It’s like yelling at the trideo. Saying it louder isn’t helping either. 1 They’re either happy to see us for lunch or happy to see us as lunch. It’s mostly emotional context, with a word or two dropped in just to make things interesting. 2 See Dick run. Run, Dick, run. Rudimentary conversation with a kindergarten vocabulary. 3 Credstick. Nuyen. Guns. Normal Sixth World conversation stuff. Nothing too technical. 4+ Nuclear physics, anyone? Conversation about more complex concepts, with detailed vocabulary, can be had.
spell.treat.desc=Treat removes or lessens damaging or debilitating status effects. Reduce the Blinded, Burning, Corrosive, or Deafened status by one level per net hit, or simply remove the Chilled or Dazed status. If there are multiple statuses, net hits can be split between them, but at a cost of +1 Drain for each additional status removed or reduced. Since there are many status effects, the gamemaster has final say if Treat can remove or reduce a particular status.
spell.trid_phantasm.desc=With this spell, the caster projects a particularimage into the area of effect (along withaccompanying sounds and smells). Maybe it’sthe image of an attacking dragon, or a peacefulgarden, or of a specific individual—whatever itis, it has to be something the caster has seen before,and the phantasm must stay in their line ofsight. The spellcaster rolls Sorcery + Magic; thenet hits form the threshold of any Willpower +Intuition tests viewers must make to see throughthe illusion.Phantasm affects every living being that seesthe effect; Trid Phantasm affects cameras, microphones,and other technology.
spell.tsunami.desc=Targets of the spell gain the Wet status (p. 53, SR6). If successful, each target is pushed back 1 meter away from the caster or the center of the spell. If net hits exceed the Body of the target, then the target is knocked Prone (p. 53, SR6). Any additional net hits (resisted by the target rolling their Body) become the number of meters that the target is pushed back in addition to the first meter These spells are not recommended for drinking purposes for pressure reasons. Water temperature may vary, though most subjects say it’s slightly cooler than room temperature.
spell.vehicle_armor.desc=Many shadowrunners learn only too late that car doors are not impenetrable shields against bullets. But with this spell, they can be! Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance of the vehicle; the vehicle gains 1 point of Hardened Armor per net hit
spell.vehicle_mask.desc=Change the appearance of your home or office with the illusory features and textures of Phantomscape. Why bring your friends over to your double-wide when it could look like a small keep, an English cottage complete with the scent of a blossoming garden and tea, or even a cabin in the woods (ominous background music optional). The same goes for your POS 5000. You might not be able to afford a Mitsubishi Nightsky, but you can make it look like you drive one with Vehicle Mask does not change the physical attributes of your vehicle. Vehicle Mask covers a standard passenger vehicle or drone; the Increase Area effect can be used once to make it cover an SUV-sized vehicle, pickup, or passenger van; twice to cover a panel truck, shuttle bus, or shipping van; three times to cover a semi truck or bus. The illusion can be larger than the affected vehicle, but not smaller.
spell.vine.desc=Must target living, willing plants. Remember that carrots distrust wizards. They know what happened to bok choy. Hits accelerate growth. Each hit represents a week of growth or healing of boxes of damage done to the plant (if the plant has a condition monitor). In an offensive use of the Rosebush spell, any subjects moving through the area gain the Off-Balance status (p. 106, Firing Squad), as a massive burst of vegetation (weeds, vines, branches, whatever) inhibit any movement through the area. If Sorcery test hits exceed the subject’s Strength, then the subject also receives the Hobbled status (p. 52, SR6) while moving through the area. Plants are not animated after the initial casting of the spell. Strength of the plant is equal to onehalf the Magic rating of the caster, and it can be used as a threshold for escape tests.
spell.warming_heal.desc=This spell has the same healing effect as the Heal spell (roll Sorcery + Magic [5 – Essence],heal 1 box of Stun, Physical, or Overflow damageper net hit). In addition, this variant of thespell adds a warming element that eliminates theChilled status on the targeted individual. Injuriescan only be affected once by any healing spell.
spell.wreck.desc=These spells must include an object as part of the spell formula (Firearm, Commlink, Armor, etc.). The object chosen can either be narrow or broad. These spells can be learned multiple times, each with a new object.

technique.ballestra.desc=Reduce the Edge cost for the Shank Edge Action by 1. Category: Weapon; may only be used with bladed weapons Baton Lock In the hands of a trained fighter, sticks of various lengths can be used as  rappling aids. When using a blunt weapon, you may use any technique from the Grappling category as though you were unarmed, with the option of using the weapon’s damage (including the bonus from Precision Strikes, if applicable) in place of your base unarmed damage.
technique.bending_of_the_reed_melee.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when using the Dodge Minor Action against melee or ranged attacks (choose which category when learning this technique). This technique may be taken up to twice in order to gain both the melee and the ranged Dodge bonus.
technique.close_quarters_firearms.desc=When using a rifle, shotgun, or submachine gun in melee combat, that firearm may count as a Clubs weapon for the purposes of martial arts techniques. At the gamemaster’s discretion, striking an opponent with an un-reinforced weapon may damage or even break the weapon.
technique.close_quarters_firearms_ranged.desc=When using a light pistol, heavy pistol, holdout pistol, machine pistol, or taser in melee combat, that firearm may count as a Clubs weapon for the purposes of martial arts techniques. At the gamemaster’s discretion, striking an opponent with an un-reinforced weapon may damage or even break the weapon.
technique.defiant_dance.desc=When caught in a Grapple (p. 111, SR6), the character may roll Athletics + Agility as though they were escaping from restraints in place of their normal Close Combat + Strength, using the opponent’s net hits on the opposed Strength Test to initiate the grapple as the threshold for the Escape test.
technique.dim_mak.desc=By making a Called Shot to target a specific limb, on a successful attack you may choose to inflict the Disabled status (p. 106) on the selected limb instead of inflicting damage, with every two net hits increasing the level of the status by 1.
technique.drunken_boxing.desc=You’ve been trained to move and attack in unpredictable ways, which can be both a benefit and a drawback. The number of 1s you need to glitch on any Unarmed attack is reduced by 1 due to the sloppy execution, but your target loses two dice from their Defense Tests against those attacks thanks to the difficulty in anticipating your movements.
technique.elbows_tight.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when using the Block Minor Action without a weapon. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.
technique.end_them_rightly.desc=When using a melee weapon, you may apply the bonus granted by the Feint Maneuver to an attack with a throwing weapon instead of a melee weapon. If the throwing weapon is fitted to the melee weapon as a weapon attachment, you may detach and throw it without spending a Ready Weapon Minor Action to draw the thrown weapon.
technique.entanglement.desc=This functions the same as the Edge Action (p. 93) but without the Edge cost. When using exotic weapons such as whips, chains, bolos, and lariats as part of grapple, roll Exotic Weapon + Agility vs. Agility + Reaction. If successful, not only is the opponent restrained, but with a Minor Action, the weapon now restrains the opponent, leaving the attacker free to do other things.

technique.feint.desc=By spending a Minor Action and succeeding at a Close Combat + Agility (3) test, you may reduce your target’s Defense test dice pool against your next Close Combat attack by 3 dice.
technique.flying_kick.desc=You’ve trained yourself to become a metahuman projectile, battering opponents down with your soaring feet of fury. By spending an extra Minor Action and succeeding at an Athletics + Agility (3) test, you may extend your Close range bracket by 0.5 meters/hit (not net hit) and increase your DV by 2 (stacking with the bonus from Kick Attack, for a total bonus of +3). However, a glitch on either the Athletics + Agility test to launch yourself successfully or the Close Combat + Agility test for the attack roll results in gaining the Unbalanced status until your next action, and a critical glitch on either roll makes you take a tumble, inflicting both the Prone status and the Disabled II status (p. 106) on one of your legs (randomly determined) as you twist your joints in a way they weren’t intended to move.
technique.ground_fighter.desc=You’re used to fights ending up as a mass of tangled limbs rolling around on the nearest flat surface. You never suffer penalties for attacking or defending while you have the Prone status (p. 53, SR6), and the penalty to your Defense tests while restrained is reduced by half (rounded down).
technique.half_sword.desc=Increase the Attack Rating of the weapon by 2 when making Half-Sword attacks, but reduce the Close Range bracket by 1 meter. Category: Weapon; may only be used with swords
technique.iaijutsu.desc=Like the samurai of old (or at least the ones in the trids), the character may use the Quick Draw Minor Action (p. 42, SR6) with any properly stored melee weapon that is small enough to be wielded in one hand—no quick-drawing polearms, unless it’s dwarf-sized and you’re a troll. The character must still use the Quick Draw action together with the Attack Major Action.
technique.iron_limbs.desc=Add +1 DV to your base unarmed damage.
technique.jiao_di.desc=This probably wasn’t what your parents meant when they told you to “use your head,” but it works. You may use a head butt to make unarmed attacks at half your normal Close range increment even when your limbs are otherwise immobile, including while grappling or being grappled, and you gain +1 DV to those attacks (does not stack with Iron Limbs or Ti Khao). Also, when defending against a grapple, you may attempt to damage your opponent as though you were the attacker (p. 111, SR6).
technique.joint_lock.desc=When executing a grapple (p. 111, SR6), the character may use the “Inflict Damage” option to inflict the Disabled status (p. 106) on the grappled arm or leg, with every two net hits increasing the level of the status by 1.
technique.kick_attack.desc=You’ve been trained to use all sorts of kicks effectively in combat, whether they’re front kicks, side kicks, or even the legendary roundhouse kick (beard optional). When attacking with Kick Attack, add +1 to your unarmed Damage Value and 2 meters to your Close Range. Rolling a glitch on a Kick Attack inflicts the Off-Balance status on you, while rolling a critical glitch inflicts the Prone status.
technique.mean_right_hook.desc=Reduce the Edge cost of the Knockout Blow Edge Action (p. 47, SR6) by 1.
technique.meridian_strike.desc=By combining their Awakened talents with their martial arts expertise, adept practitioners of hapsum-do may disrupt the flow of mana in their opponent’s bodies.

technique.multi_opponent_combat.desc=When using the Multiple Attacks Minor Action to attack multiple targets, add 1 die to your attack pool for every two targets you attack. (For the purposes of this technique, attacking multiple locations on the same target counts as one target.)
technique.multi_opponent_defense.desc=When you’re attacked by multiple attackers in the same Combat Round, gain +2 to your Defense Rating on all attacks after the first. This bonus is not cumulative; if you’re attacked three times, you get +2 to your Defense Ratings against the second and third attacks, not +2 against the second and +4 against the third.
technique.neijia.desc=You might not be Awakened, but you’ve learned to channel your qi (or ki, prana, ruach, pneuma, “spirit energy,” or sheer meanness) into a strike that reaches across the boundaries between material and immaterial. You may make unarmed attacks against astral entities as though you were Awakened (see Astral Combat, p. 160, SR6), with a Damage Value of (WILL/2 + net hits). This technique does not give you the ability to perceive astrally or bond weapon foci.
technique.oaken_stance.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when resisting attempts to knock you prone in melee combat. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.
technique.parry.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when using the Block Minor Action with a weapon. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.
technique.pin.desc=This works the same as the Edge Action of the same name, only without the Edge cost. With this attack, if the number of hits exceeded the Defense Rating of the target, regardless if whether attack inflicted actual any damage or not, then the opponent has been pinned to the wall or floor, giving them the Immobilized status. The opponent must spend a Pick Up/Put Down Object action to remove the Immobilized status.
technique.precision_strikes.desc=Thanks to extensive training with your chosen weapon, you may add (STR/3, rounded up) to the DV of your attacks when using weapons from the specified category. This technique may be taken multiple times, applying to a different category of weapon (Blades, Clubs, Exotic) each time it’s taken.
technique.releasing_talons.desc=Reduce the Edge cost of the Wrest Edge Action (p. 47, SR6) by 1.

technique.sacrifice_throw.desc=“If I’m going down, I’m taking you with me!” If an attacker manages to knock you prone, you may immediately spend a Minor Action (if you have one) to attempt to knock them down as though you were tackling them (see Grapple, p. 111, SR6).
technique.striking_the_darkness.desc=When in melee combat in low-light conditions (see Environment and Visibility, p. 118, SR6), you are treated as having a vision enhancement for the purposes of gaining Edge.
technique.sweep_the_leg.desc=When performing the Trip Minor Action while unarmed, you receive a free point of situational Edge that goes away if you do not use it on the Trip test.
technique.tameshiwari.desc=Boards might not hit back, but you never know when it’ll be useful to break through a solid surface with your hands, feet, head, or other part of your body. When attacking a barrier (including magical barriers that impede the user’s physical movement) with an unarmed attack, treat the barrier as if the Structure rating were 4 lower for the purposes of determining damage. At the gamemaster’s discretion, a glitch or critical glitch may result in the attacker breaking their own hand/foot/head on the offending object.
technique.threatening_edge.desc=This works the same as the Edge Action of the same name, only without the Edge cost. For the duration of an encounter, while wielding a melee weapon, the character’s Defense Rating is replaced by the Close Attack Rating of the weapon.
technique.ti_khao.desc=You’ve been trained to use your knees to attack an opponent while grappling, whether by kneeling on them to choke them out or striking them for a bit of extra oomph. Add +1 DV to damage you inflict while grappling (see Grapple, p. 111, SR6).
technique.tricking.desc=Flashy spinning kicks, twirling staves, and shooting the cigarette out of an opponent’s mouth might not be practical in the normal sense, but if done right, they can impress your friends and scare your enemies. Whenever you make a Teamwork test to help an ally intimidate a target, including using the Big Speech Edge Action (p. 47, SR6), you may roll Weapon Skill + Agility in place of Influence + Charisma. (When using this technique with the Big Speech Edge Action, only the first Influence + Charisma test may be replaced with Weapon Skill + Agility, not both.)
technique.two_weapon_fighting.desc=When using the Multiple Attacks Minor Action with more than one weapon, gain an additional two dice to split between your attacks.
technique.weapon_breaker.desc=When using Called Shot—Disarm, reduce either the Edge cost (if spending Edge) or the dice pool penalty (if not spending Edge) by 1.
