item.adrenaline_pump.desc=This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure test (p. 67); otherwise you can trigger it as a Minor Action. While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers, don’t fall unconscious even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled, you can’t rest, and the adrenaline pump’s rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for (rating x 1D6) combat rounds, and it can’t be switched off early. When time’s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to one half, rounded up, of the number of combat rounds the pump was active (use unaugmented Body to resist the damage). After the effect’s end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires one hour to regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated.
item.damage_compensator.desc=Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun, or a combination of the two) equal to the compensator’s rating before determining your injury modifiers.
item.cats_eyes.desc=These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vision, providing low-light vision (p. 72). Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyberware eye replacements, but individual vision enhancements can be purchased.
item.enhanced_articulation.desc=A number of procedures like joint-surface coating, re-lubrication, and tendon and ligament augmentation lead to more fluid muscle and joint action. Enhanced articulation provides you with a +1 Agility and a bonus Edge when trying to move through cramped or confining spaces.
item.muscle_augmentation.desc=This biological weaving treatment enhances existing muscle tissue, rather than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are woven into existing muscle fibers, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your Strength attribute. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Strength, including the muscle replacement cyberware.
item.muscle_toner.desc=This treatment increases muscle-fiber elasticity in existing muscle tension, resulting in increased muscle tension and flexibility while providing a smooth and ropy physique. Muscle toner adds its rating to your Agility attribute. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Agility, including the muscle replacement cyberware and enhanced articulation bioware.
item.orthoskin.desc=A web of biofibers in the skin provides the equivalent of personal armor while being virtually indistinguishable from natural skin. Orthoskin provides a bonus equal to its rating to your Defense Rating. Orthoskin cannot be combined with skin augmentations, including dermal plating.
item.platelet_factories.desc=Platelet factories increase your body’s ability to handle Physical damage by accelerating the production of platelets and their concentration in the blood, which helps stop bleeding faster. Any time you would take 2 or more boxes of damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, reduce the damage by 1 box.
item.skin_pocket.desc=This skin flap can be located anywhere on your body. A nerveless sheath of flesh concealed by the flap is perfect for hiding a small object—it’s a bioware version of a smuggling compartment (p. 287). The skin pocket has a Concealability threshold of 10. It takes a Major Action to add or remove an item from a skin pocket.
item.suprathyroid_gland.desc=Placed on top of your existing thyroid gland, the suprathyroid gland supersedes the metabolic functions of your thyroid. The enhanced metabolism produces more energy, supercharging you. In order to fuel your optimized metabolism, you’ll need to eat twice as much as normal. You get a +1 to your Agility, Body, Reaction, and Strength, along with a 25 percent boost in Lifestyle costs.
item.symbiotes.desc=Tailored micro-organisms in your bloodstream greatly enhance your healing. Add the rating of the symbiotes as a dice pool modifier on healing tests (Physical and Stun). However, the symbiotes have unusual dietary requirements that must be met to keep them alive. You need to pay (Rating x 200) nuyen per month for special symbiote food, although if you have a High Lifestyle or better, it’s covered. If they are not fed, they die in a month.
item.synthacardium.desc=Artificially enhanced myocardium allows cardiovascular functions to be performed more efficiently, enabling the heart to keep the blood better oxygenated. The synthacardium adds its rating as a dice pool bonus to your Athletics skill tests for running, swimming, and climbing.
item.tailored_pheremones.desc=These pheromones are specially tailored to subtly influence others and can be released at will. Tailored pheromones increase your Charisma attribute by their Rating for Con and Influence tests, but only when the person you’re using them on is within a comfortable conversation range—if they can’t smell you, the pheromones don’t work. Tailored pheromones have no effect on magical abilities and tests.
item.toxin_etractor.desc=A specially cultivated cluster of cells in your liver improves its filtering capabilities. The toxin extractor subtracts its rating from the threshold of Toxin Resistance tests (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121).
item.tracheal_filter.desc=Implanted at the top of your trachea, this organ can absorb airborne impurities and keep them from reaching your lungs. The filter adds its rating as a dice pool bonus to Toxin Resistance tests versus Inhalation-vector toxins (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121).
item.vocal_expansion.desc=A terrifying upgrade usually undertaken only by those who’ve suffered throat damage but sometimes gambled on by those who need the extra edge to break in, vocal expansion is a series of minor bioware improvements to the throat and lungs, controlling the flow of air through the voice box, strengthening the user’s natural abilities to create longer, clearer notes, a more powerful sound, and a throat more resistant to hoarseness and strain. If it goes wrong, it can ruin someone’s career forever or, in a worst-case scenario, render them mute. Currently the upgrade is reserved to beta or delta clinics, but once perfected, it should filter down to standard clinics in a few years. A vocal expansion raises the user’s natural limit for Leadership tests using Influence and Performance (singing) tests using Con by its rating.
item.cerebral_booster.desc=The convolutions and gyri of your cerebrum are augmented and amplified with additional nervous tissue, improving overall brain function. Your cerebral booster increases your Logic attribute by its rating.
item.damage_compensator.desc=Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun, or a combination of the two) equal to the compensator’s rating before determining your injury modifiers.
item.mnemonic_enhancer.desc=This highly concentrated growth of grey matter gets attached to the brain’s memory centers, improving both short- and long-term memory. Add the enhancer’s rating as a dice pool bonus to your Knowledge, Language, and memory-related tests.
item.pain_editor.desc=This cluster of specialized nervous tissue is designed to filter sensory stimuli. If the pain editor is active, this allows you to ignore all injury modifiers, and you even stay conscious when your Stun Condition Monitor is completely full. You feel no pain—you’re blissfully, dangerously, recklessly unaware of the extent of damage you’ve taken without either performing a self-examination (Observe in Detail action) or being informed by a biomonitor (p. 281). While active, the pain editor increases your Willpower by 1 and decreases your Intuition by 1; additionally, all tactile Perception tests you make have their threshold increased by 1.
item.reflex_recorder.desc=This system uses extra nervous tissue linked to specific areas of the body to improve muscle memory. The reflex recorder adds 1 to the rating of a skill linked to a Physical attribute. Multiple recorders may be taken for multiple skills, but you can’t implant two reflex recorders for the same skill.
item.sleep_regulator.desc=The sleep regulator is a modification to the hypothalamus, allowing for longer periods of wakefulness, an incredibly useful advantage for anyone with any profession, not just shadowrunners. You need less sleep per day, and the sleep you get is deep and restful (and harder to wake you up from). The sleep regulator lets you get by with three hours of sleep each night, and you can stay awake for twice as long as normal without acquiring the Fatigued status (p. 52). Resting hours for healing purposes are not affected.
item.synaptic_booster.desc=The nerve cells making up the spinal cord are both broadened and replicated with this bioware, allowing for more neural bandwidth. The result is a much faster reaction time. The booster confers a bonus of +1 Reaction (with accompanying bonus to your Initiative Score) and 1 additional Initiative Die (with accompanying Minor Action). The synaptic booster cannot be combined with any other form of Reaction or Initiative enhancement. Unlike other enhancements, this cannot be turned off, leaving the user in a perpetual state of being surrounded by slow motion.
quality.dermal_deposits.desc=You have calciferous deposits growing on or through your flesh, making you tougher and a little rough around the edges. Literally. You gain 1 level of natural Armor.
item.bone_density_augmentation_1.desc=The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density increases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical damage. Your unarmed combat damage becomes Physical and your Damage Value and Attack Rating increase per the table below. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.
item.bone_density_augmentation_2.desc=The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density increases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical damage. Your unarmed combat damage becomes Physical and your Damage Value and Attack Rating increase per the table below. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.
item.bone_density_augmentation_3.desc=The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density increases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical damage. Your unarmed combat damage becomes Physical and your Damage Value and Attack Rating increase per the table below. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.
item.bone_density_augmentation_4.desc=The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density increases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical damage. Your unarmed combat damage becomes Physical and your Damage Value and Attack Rating increase per the table below. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware.
martialart.52blocks.desc=Known by a wide variety of other names, 52 Blocks evolved from fighting styles practiced by African American slaves and was further developed by inmates in American prison systems throughout the twentieth century. The style is highly defensive and mobile, highlighted by the “52 blocks” that give it its name, while also incorporating striking and knife techniques. Signature Technique: Elbows In;
martialart.aikido.desc=Widely known as the “pacifist’s martial art,” aikido is a “soft” martial art that relies on using the opponent’s force against them. The techniques are almost purely defensive, emphasizing disarming and restraining attackers without inflicting harm. Aikido also possesses a strong spiritual element, combining traditional Buddhist and Shinto beliefs with a philosophy of peace and non-violence. Signature Technique: Sacrifice Throw;
martialart.arnis.desc=An umbrella term for a collection of Filipino martial arts, arnis (also known as arnis de mano, escrima, or kali) emphasizes the use of paired rattan sticks (baston) or daggers (baraw/daga), as well as longer blunt and bladed weapons, unarmed strikes, and joint locks. Similar Styles: Banshay (Myanmar), gatka/shastar vidya (India), krabi-krabong (Thailand), Nguni stick fighting (Azania) Signature Technique: Two-Weapon Fighting;
martialart.bartitsu.desc=Known as the “gentleman’s martial art” and made famous by literary heroes like Sherlock Holmes and John Steed, bartitsu teaches the use of a cane or umbrella—back in the day, those were objects people might carry on an everyday basis— as a self-defense tool. Signature Technique: Parry;
martialart.boxing.desc=Ah, good ol’ fisticuffs. Boxing is the ancient art of punching someone until they fall over, hopefully before they punch you until you fall over. The styles of individual boxers vary greatly—some are highly mobile and throw flurries of punches, while others focus on taking punishment until they can knock their opponent out in a single blow. The chief difference is that unlike other styles of unarmed combat, boxing relies on fists alone. Signature Technique: Mean Right Hook;
martialart.capoeira.desc=Developed in Amazonia (then known as Brazil) by slaves of African heritage, capoeira has practitioners who avoid detection by disguising their art as a dance. Since the practitioners’ hands were often shackled, preventing them from attacking or defending effectively with their arms, capoeira emphasizes highly evasive movements and leg techniques like kicks and sweeping the legs. Similar Styles: Engolo (Angola); Signature Technique: Feint;
martialart.careomeleg.desc=The much-celebrated elven martial art relies on quick, accurate strikes (both unarmed and with various bladed weapons) and highly mobile defenses, often leading to the claim that there are “no stances” in carromeleg. Claims that the style was actually developed in a previous age of the world continue to swirl, and traditionally minded carromeleg instructors will only accept elves as students— but a handful of carromeleg masters have begun sharing their style with non-elves, leading to a great deal of friction within the carromeleg community (such as it is). Techniques: Bending of the Reed (Melee);
martialart.chakram_fighting.desc=The chakram is originally a throwing weapon from the Indian subcontinent, though it was widely used across various parts of Asia. It typically takes the form of a sharpened ring that can be worn as jewelry until it was needed in combat. The chakram can also be worn as a sharpened knuckle-duster, provided the user is willing to risk cutting their own hand. Similar Styles: Shurikenjutsu (Japan);Signature Technique: Pin;
martialart.close_quarters_combat.desc=“Combatives” is a general description for practically focused, “tactical” martial arts developed for use by law enforcement and military personnel, rather than traditional styles carried into the present day. They often include a mix of grappling and striking techniques, including baton techniques, disarming opponents with weapons, and methods of using firearms in hand-to-hand combat. Similar Styles: Krav Maga, MCMAP, Systema; Signature Technique: Releasing Talons;
martialart.european_fencing_longsword.desc=One of many weapons flying the banner of “historical European martial arts,” the longsword is the archetypal two-handed sword used throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. Its resurgence in the Sixth World came about thanks to the re-discovery of manuals by masters like Fiore dei Liberi and Johannes Lichentauer, which gained special traction among street samurai who disdain the katana as being over-hyped. Originally developed for the battlefield, longsword fencing is perfect for those who intend to cut through swathes of opponents in a single swing. Signature Technique: Half-Sword;
martialart.european_fencing_rapier.desc=This is not modern sport fencing, but rather combat in the style of Bonetti, Capo Ferro, Thibault, Agrippa, and that one classic flatvid duel from the 1980s. Most twenty-first-century fencing is based on techniques that originated in France and Italy, although the Spanish style of la verdadera destreza has gained quite a bit of traction in recent years. European duelists often paired their rapiers with an off-hand weapon like a dagger, a tradition that’s survived into the modern day. Signature Technique: Ballestra;
martialart.gun_kata.desc=More of a performance art than a combat art in its twentieth-century flatvid incarnations, Gun Kata (also known as Gun Fu) has taken on a new practicality in an era of supernaturally and technologically enhanced reflexes and aim. The style focuses on the use of the pistol as both a melee and ranged weapon, and many Gun Kata practitioners modify their guns to increase their sturdiness in melee (and disable the annoying warnings from their smartlinks about improper shooting posture). Gun Kata retains some of the flashiness of its showbiz origins, and Gun Kata stylists have been known to incorporate both acrobatics and trick shots into their fighting style. Signature Technique: Close-Quarters Firearms (Handguns);
martialart.hapsum_do.desc=Though adepts practice a wide variety of martial arts styles with fearsome effectiveness, hapsum-do (or the Way of Unified Mana) is the first martial arts style developed specifically to make use of an adept’s supernatural powers. Grandmaster “Barghest” Knorr, an adept who travels around the world to share his techniques, is widely acknowledged as the founder of the style. Functionally similar to other “hybrid” arts that include both grappling and striking techniques (and thus usable by non-adepts in many respects), certain hapsum-do techniques rely on the practitioners’ Awakened abilities to be effective. Signature Technique: Meridian Strike;
martialart.jeet_kune_do.desc=The style of Jeet Kune Do was first developed by the legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, combining elements of many existing martial arts styles under a philosophy of “whatever works”—the same philosophy applied by practitioners of mixed martial arts, who often study both grappling and striking styles (jujutsu and Muay Thai is a popular combination) to ensure their effectiveness in the ring. Similar Styles: Hapkido (Korea); Signature Technique: Sweep the Leg;
martialart.jogo_do_pao.desc=Developed in Portugal, Jogo do Pao is effectively staff fighting. It evolved from the techniques that residents of rural areas used to fend off dangerous wildlife with long walking sticks. Its popularity fell as time passed and more people moved into the city, but it maintained enough of a following to survive into the Sixth World. Similar Styles: Ball de bastons (Iberian peninsula),canne de combat (France); Signature Technique: Threatening Edge;
martialart.jujutsu.desc=Jujutsu (and its combat-sport variant, judo) is an unarmed combat style from Japan that focuses heavily on grappling, restraining/subduing, and throwing techniques. It’s frequently studied by police officers for the purposes of disarming and arresting suspects, and by bouncers for escorting unruly customers off the premises. Similar Styles: Malla-yuddha (India), sambo (Russia), shuai jiao (China); Signature Technique: Joint Lock;
martialart.karate.desc=One of the first Asian martial arts introduced to the Western world, karate originates from Okinawa and focuses primarily on striking, with particular emphasis on the fists and other parts of the hand (“karate” translates as “empty hand”). Kicking techniques are relatively common in karate, while grappling and weapon use is more rare. Similar Styles: Tang Soo Do (Korea); Signature Technique: Tameshiwari;
martialart.kenjutsu.desc=A term well-known to both street samurai and anyone within earshot of a Japanese culture enthusiast, kenjutsu is the art of fighting with the Japanese sword. It’s strongly associated with the katana, but most kenjutsu styles also include techniques for using the kodachi/wakizashi (short swords) and tanto (dagger), as well as the related art of battojutsu/iaijutsu (the art of drawing the sword and attacking in the same motion). The sport form, kendo, is widely popular in Japan. Similar Styles: Geom beop (Korea); Signature Technique: Iaijutsu;
martialart.kickboxing.desc=As one might guess from the name, kickboxing is boxing with the addition of feet—and often elbows, knees, and other body parts, including the head. Much like its hands-only cousin, kickboxing relies almost exclusively on striking, with relatively little in the way of grappling or weapons techniques (though many kickboxing styles have companion arts focusing on the use of weapons). Similar Styles: Lethwei (Myanmar), Muay Boran/Muay Thai (Thailand), Muay Lao (Laos), Musti-yuddha (India), Pradal Serey (Cambodia), sanshou (China);Signature Technique: Ti Khao;
martialart.knight_errant_tactical.desc=These two combat systems, developed by the law-enforcement corps whose names they bear, are essentially Sixth World spins on the CQC combatives of the twentieth century. Practitioners of either style would swear that their approach was completely different than the other guys. At the end of the day, though, both Knight Errant and Lone Star deal with basically the same situations in the course of their duties, and each corp’s approach to dealing with those situations is fundamentally similar. The primary difference between the two styles is that Knight Errant places more emphasis on disarming individual attackers (you never know when they might be a SINner who can file a complaint and cause a PR headache), while Lone Star focuses on crowd control. Signature Techniques: Multiple Opponent; Combat (Lone Star Tactical)/Releasing Talons(Knight Errant Tactical);
martialart.kung_fu.desc=More properly a group of related martial arts styles, the term “kung fu” usually applies to the “external” or “hard” styles characterized by dynamic, physically strenuous techniques with a heavy emphasis on striking. Popular examples of kung fu styles include the Five Animals style, the Shaolin styles, Wing Chun, and wushu. Similar Styles: Silat/pencak silat (Indonesia), silat Melayu (Malaysia), Shorinji kempo (Japan); Signature Technique: Drunken Boxing;
martialart.kung_fu_18.desc=Historically, many styles of martial arts integrated the study of weapons into the same curriculum as unarmed techniques. In China, the four main martial arts weapons were the spear (qiang), staff (gun), saber (dao), and straight sword (jian), along with more exotic weapons like the halberd, three-section staff, and rope dart. Similar Styles: Bojutsu (Japan), kobudo (Okinawa), quarterstaff fighting; Signature Technique: Tricking;
martialart.kyujutsu.desc=Kyujutsu is a Japanese form of archery using an unusually long bow called a yumi, the largest of which were sometimes taller than their wielders. Originally practiced by the samurai, kyujutsu fell out of mainstream use with the introduction of firearms, but it has regained popularity in the Sixth World for both cultural and practical reasons. Similar Styles: Turkish archery (Turkey); Signature Technique: Pin;
martialart.lone_star_tactical.desc=These two combat systems, developed by the law-enforcement corps whose names they bear, are essentially Sixth World spins on the CQC combatives of the twentieth century. Practitioners of either style would swear that their approach was completely different than the other guys. At the end of the day, though, both Knight Errant and Lone Star deal with basically the same situations in the course of their duties, and each corp’s approach to dealing with those situations is fundamentally similar. The primary difference between the two styles is that Knight Errant places more emphasis on disarming individual attackers (you never know when they might be a SINner who can file a complaint and cause a PR headache), while Lone Star focuses on crowd control. Signature Techniques: Multiple Opponent; Combat (Lone Star Tactical)/Releasing Talons(Knight Errant Tactical);
martialart.ninjutsu.desc=Though widely known in popular culture as assassins, ninja were historically infiltrators and spies. In contrast to the samurai (and much like shadowrunners), ninjas were willing to employ any number of “dishonorable” techniques to win battles and achieve their objectives. Stealth and quickly disabling opponents were key tenets of ninjutsu (sometimes known as taijutsu). Ninja combat arts also included many weapons techniques, most notably the use of the shuriken. Signature Technique: Dim Mak;
martialart.okichitaw.desc=Originating with the Plains Cree of North America, Okichitaw is one of the few indigenous North American fighting styles to have survived into the Sixth World. The style is highly aggressive and focuses neutralizing opponents with rapid takedowns. The primary weapon used in Okichitaw is the gunstock war club, though the style also incorporates the tomahawk and dagger. Signature Technique: Close-Quarter Firearms (Longarms);
martialart.oni_ryu_taijutsu.desc=The Oni Do Kai is a group of Yakuza “ninja” (freelance operatives) composed almost entirely of orks and trolls. Early on, Oni Do Kai members recognized that their imposing size and strength would put them at a disadvantage in the same country that produced judo and jujutsu, and they began modifying their style of ninjutsu to turn those weaknesses into strengths—and thus, Oniryu taijutsu was born. Nobody’s quite sure why the Oni Do Kai decided to share their techniques with outsiders, but that hasn’t stopped orks and trolls around Japan (and in other countries with large Japanese communities) from signing up for classes in droves. After the Oni Do Kai went semi-public, other tusker-focused martial arts groups with their own styles (under names like Trog Kwan Do and Tuskrima, among others) followed suit, and the community is growing rapidly. Signature Technique: Oaken Stance;
martialart.parkour.desc=Not strictly a martial art, parkour was developed as a form of quick and effective movement through dense urban environments. Many of the techniques used in parkour can be adapted to martial arts practice, whether to gain a tactical advantage over an opponent or just run the hell away from a fight you shouldn’t have picked. Signature Technique: Rolling Clouds;
martialart.sangre_y_acero.desc=After the invention of functional cybernetic limbs in the 2030s, it was only a matter of time before someone designed cyberlimbs that were optimized for combat. Originating in the gladiator pits of Tenochtitlán, Sangre y Acero (also known as Etzilitzli and Ars Cybernetica) makes the best possible use of the advantages granted by cyberlimbs, especially against other melee weapons. Signature Technique: Iron Limbs;
martialart.tae_kwon_do.desc=Like its Japanese counterpart, karate, tae kwon do was synthesized from indigenous Korean fighting styles and external styles of kung fu imported from China. Tae kwon do is famous for its flashy high and spinning kicks, often complimented with rapid hand strikes, and continues to be one of the most popular combat sports in Korea. Similar Styles: Savate (France); Signature Technique: Flying Kick;
martialart.the_cowboy_way.desc=Popularized by flatvids set in the American West, the art now referred to as the Cowboy Way—using the lasso to entangle enemies at range—arguably has its origins with the Huns and other nomadic cultures of central Asia. The additions of fisticuffs, gun-twirling, and ten-gallon hats are almost certainly American innovations. Given the similarities of the weapons, many of the techniques used in the Cowboy Way can also be applied to Similar Styles: Latigo y daga (Philippines), nawajutsu (Japan), whip fighting; Signature Technique: Entanglement;
martialart.wildcat.desc=When the Sioux Wildcats finally lifted their ban on cybernetics in unit members in 2080, it was anyone’s guess whether their in-house martial art would flourish or suffer because of it. The jury’s still out, but the style—a blend of Okichitaw, aikido, karate, and Muay Thai that focuses on disabling opponents as quickly as possible—is as effective as ever, particularly against non-augmented opponents (like the Wildcats’ arch-rivals, the Tír Ghosts). Signature Techniques: Releasing Talons;
martialart.wrestling.desc=Although “wrestling” is an extremely broad category (in much the same way as “kung fu”), in a general sense, wrestling consists of grabbing a part of your opponent’s body (or an item of clothing), then bending it into a pretzel or pinning them to the ground until they beg you to stop. In some cases, like in Japanese sumo, it’s possible to win matches by pushing the opponent out of the ring. Signature Technique: Sacrifice Throw;
technique.ballestra.desc=Reduce the Edge cost for the Shank Edge Action by 1. Category: Weapon; may only be used with bladed weapons Baton Lock In the hands of a trained fighter, sticks of various lengths can be used as  rappling aids. When using a blunt weapon, you may use any technique from the Grappling category as though you were unarmed, with the option of using the weapon’s damage (including the bonus from Precision Strikes, if applicable) in place of your base unarmed damage.
technique.bending_of_the_reed_melee.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when using the Dodge Minor Action against melee or ranged attacks (choose which category when learning this technique). This technique may be taken up to twice in order to gain both the melee and the ranged Dodge bonus. 
technique.close_quarters_firearms_ranged.desc=When using a light pistol, heavy pistol, holdout pistol, machine pistol, or taser in melee combat, that firearm may count as a Clubs weapon for the purposes of martial arts techniques. At the gamemaster’s discretion, striking an opponent with an un-reinforced weapon may damage or even break the weapon.
technique.close_quarters_firearms.desc=When using a rifle, shotgun, or submachine gun in melee combat, that firearm may count as a Clubs weapon for the purposes of martial arts techniques. At the gamemaster’s discretion, striking an opponent with an un-reinforced weapon may damage or even break the weapon.
technique.defiant_dance.desc=When caught in a Grapple (p. 111, SR6), the character may roll Athletics + Agility as though they were escaping from restraints in place of their normal Close Combat + Strength, using the opponent’s net hits on the opposed Strength Test to initiate the grapple as the threshold for the Escape test.
technique.dim_mak.desc=By making a Called Shot to target a specific limb, on a successful attack you may choose to inflict the Disabled status (p. 106) on the selected limb instead of inflicting damage, with every two net hits increasing the level of the status by 1. 
technique.drunken_boxing.desc=You’ve been trained to move and attack in unpredictable ways, which can be both a benefit and a drawback. The number of 1s you need to glitch on any Unarmed attack is reduced by 1 due to the sloppy execution, but your target loses two dice from their Defense Tests against those attacks thanks to the difficulty in anticipating your movements.
technique.elbows_tight.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when using the Block Minor Action without a weapon. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.
technique.end_them_rightly.desc=When using a melee weapon, you may apply the bonus granted by the Feint Maneuver to an attack with a throwing weapon instead of a melee weapon. If the throwing weapon is fitted to the melee weapon as a weapon attachment, you may detach and throw it without spending a Ready Weapon Minor Action to draw the thrown weapon.
technique.entanglement.desc=This functions the same as the Edge Action (p. 93) but without the Edge cost. When using exotic weapons such as whips, chains, bolos, and lariats as part of grapple, roll Exotic Weapon + Agility vs. Agility + Reaction. If successful, not only is the opponent restrained, but with a Minor Action, the weapon now restrains the opponent, leaving the attacker free to do other things. If net hits of the attack exceed the opponent’s Agility, the opponent gains the Hobbled status for a number of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits. 
technique.feint.desc=By spending a Minor Action and succeeding at a Close Combat + Agility (3) test, you may reduce your target’s Defense test dice pool against your next Close Combat attack by 3 dice.
technique.flying_kick.desc=You’ve trained yourself to become a metahuman projectile, battering opponents down with your soaring feet of fury. By spending an extra Minor Action and succeeding at an Athletics + Agility (3) test, you may extend your Close range bracket by 0.5 meters/hit (not net hit) and increase your DV by 2 (stacking with the bonus from Kick Attack, for a total bonus of +3). However, a glitch on either the Athletics + Agility test to launch yourself successfully or the Close Combat + Agility test for the attack roll results in gaining the Unbalanced status until your next action, and a critical glitch on either roll makes you take a tumble, inflicting both the Prone status and the Disabled II status (p. 106) on one of your legs (randomly determined) as you twist your joints in a way they weren’t intended to move.
technique.ground_fighter.desc=You’re used to fights ending up as a mass of tangled limbs rolling around on the nearest flat surface. You never suffer penalties for attacking or defending while you have the Prone status (p. 53, SR6), and the penalty to your Defense tests while restrained is reduced by half (rounded down).
technique.half_sword.desc=Increase the Attack Rating of the weapon by 2 when making Half-Sword attacks, but reduce the Close Range bracket by 1 meter. Category: Weapon; may only be used with swords Iaijutsu Like the samurai of old (or at least the ones in the trids), the character may use the Quick Draw Minor Action (p. 42, SR6) with any properly stored melee weapon that is small enough to be wielded in one hand—no quick-drawing polearms, unless it’s dwarf-sized and you’re a troll. The character must still use the Quick Draw action together with the Attack Major Action.
technique.iron_limbs.desc=Add +1 DV to your base unarmed damage.
technique.jiao_di.desc=This probably wasn’t what your parents meant when they told you to “use your head,” but it works. You may use a head butt to make unarmed attacks at half your normal Close range increment even when your limbs are otherwise immobile, including while grappling or being grappled, and you gain +1 DV to those attacks (does not stack with Iron Limbs or Ti Khao). Also, when defending against a grapple, you may attempt to damage your opponent as though you were the attacker (p. 111, SR6).
technique.joint_lock.desc=When executing a grapple (p. 111, SR6), the character may use the “Inflict Damage” option to inflict the Disabled status (p. 106) on the grappled arm or leg, with every two net hits increasing the level of the status by 1.
technique.kick_attack.desc=You’ve been trained to use all sorts of kicks effectively in combat, whether they’re front kicks, side kicks, or even the legendary roundhouse kick (beard optional). When attacking with Kick Attack, add +1 to your unarmed Damage Value and 2 meters to your Close Range. Rolling a glitch on a Kick Attack inflicts the Off-Balance status on you, while rolling a critical glitch inflicts the Prone status.
technique.mean_right_hook.desc=Reduce the Edge cost of the Knockout Blow Edge Action (p. 47, SR6) by 1.
technique.meridian_strike.desc=By combining their Awakened talents with their martial arts expertise, adept practitioners of hapsum-do may disrupt the flow of mana in their opponent’s bodies.

technique.multi_opponent_combat.desc=When using the Multiple Attacks Minor Action to attack multiple targets, add 1 die to your attack pool for every two targets you attack. (For the purposes of this technique, attacking multiple locations on the same target counts as one target.)
technique.multi_opponent_defense.desc=When you’re attacked by multiple attackers in the same Combat Round, gain +2 to your Defense Rating on all attacks after the first. This bonus is not cumulative; if you’re attacked three times, you get +2 to your Defense Ratings against the second and third attacks, not +2 against the second and +4 against the third. 
technique.neijia.desc=You might not be Awakened, but you’ve learned to channel your qi (or ki, prana, ruach, pneuma, “spirit energy,” or sheer meanness) into a strike that reaches across the boundaries between material and immaterial. You may make unarmed attacks against astral entities as though you were Awakened (see Astral Combat, p. 160, SR6), with a Damage Value of (WILL/2 + net hits). This technique does not give you the ability to perceive astrally or bond weapon foci. 
technique.oaken_stance.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when resisting attempts to knock you prone in melee combat. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost.
technique.parry.desc=Gain a bonus Edge when using the Block Minor Action with a weapon. If not used immediately, the bonus Edge is lost. 
technique.pin.desc=This works the same as the Edge Action of the same name, only without the Edge cost. With this attack, if the number of hits exceeded the Defense Rating of the target, regardless if whether attack inflicted actual any damage or not, then the opponent has been pinned to the wall or floor, giving them the Immobilized status. The opponent must spend a Pick Up/Put Down Object action to remove the Immobilized status. 
technique.precision_strikes.desc=Thanks to extensive training with your chosen weapon, you may add (STR/3, rounded up) to the DV of your attacks when using weapons from the specified category. This technique may be taken multiple times, applying to a different category of weapon (Blades, Clubs, Exotic) each time it’s taken. 
technique.releasing_talons.desc=Reduce the Edge cost of the Wrest Edge Action (p. 47, SR6) by 1.

technique.sacrifice_throw.desc=“If I’m going down, I’m taking you with me!” If an attacker manages to knock you prone, you may immediately spend a Minor Action (if you have one) to attempt to knock them down as though you were tackling them (see Grapple, p. 111, SR6). 
technique.striking_the_darkness.desc=When in melee combat in low-light conditions (see Environment and Visibility, p. 118, SR6), you are treated as having a vision enhancement for the purposes of gaining Edge. 
technique.sweep_the_leg.desc=When performing the Trip Minor Action while unarmed, you receive a free point of situational Edge that goes away if you do not use it on the Trip test.
technique.tameshiwari.desc=Boards might not hit back, but you never know when it’ll be useful to break through a solid surface with your hands, feet, head, or other part of your body. When attacking a barrier (including magical barriers that impede the user’s physical movement) with an unarmed attack, treat the barrier as if the Structure rating were 4 lower for the purposes of determining damage. At the gamemaster’s discretion, a glitch or critical glitch may result in the attacker breaking their own hand/foot/head on the offending object.
technique.threatening_edge.desc=This works the same as the Edge Action of the same name, only without the Edge cost. For the duration of an encounter, while wielding a melee weapon, the character’s Defense Rating is replaced by the Close Attack Rating of the weapon. 
technique.ti_khao.desc=You’ve been trained to use your knees to attack an opponent while grappling, whether by kneeling on them to choke them out or striking them for a bit of extra oomph. Add +1 DV to damage you inflict while grappling (see Grapple, p. 111, SR6).
technique.tricking.desc=Flashy spinning kicks, twirling staves, and shooting the cigarette out of an opponent’s mouth might not be practical in the normal sense, but if done right, they can impress your friends and scare your enemies. Whenever you make a Teamwork test to help an ally intimidate a target, including using the Big Speech Edge Action (p. 47, SR6), you may roll Weapon Skill + Agility in place of Influence + Charisma. (When using this technique with the Big Speech Edge Action, only the first Influence + Charisma test may be replaced with Weapon Skill + Agility, not both.) 
technique.two_weapon_fighting.desc=When using the Multiple Attacks Minor Action with more than one weapon, gain an additional two dice to split between your attacks.
technique.weapon_breaker.desc=When using Called Shot—Disarm, reduce either the Edge cost (if spending Edge) or the dice pool penalty (if not spending Edge) by 1. 
quality.ambidextrous.desc=You are equally adept at using either your right or left side. Whether shooting a gun, throwing a grenade, or kicking a ball, you can switch it up with the best of them. Game Effect: No penalty for off-hand weapon use (see p. 110).

quality.aptitude.desc=The best look up to you. You have the natural potential to be even better than the best in a particular skill. Game Effect: Your skill maximum for the selected skill is 10, instead of 9, and your maximum starting rank is 7, instead of 6. 
quality.astral_chameleon.desc=Your aura never seems to stabilize for very long. You have the ability to blend in with the astral environment around you and make it harder to identify and read your aura and astral signature. Game Effect: Characters receive –2 dice on tests to recognize your aura or astral signature. Your astral signature fades in half the normal time (see p. 159). 
quality.blandness.desc=You are the least interesting person in the world. Average height, average weight, average build, average everything. Nothing at all about you tends to stand out, and that can be extremely useful. Game Effect: Characters take a –2 penalty on Memory tests (p. 67) to remember if they have seen you before, and the threshold on tests to notice if you are following or observing them is increased by 1. 
quality.built_tough.desc=You’re built like a brick drekhouse. You’re pretty good at taking a few extra hits before the lights go out. Game Effect: You have a number of additional boxes on your Physical Condition Monitor equal to the rank of this quality.

quality.dermal_deposits.desc=You have calciferous deposits growing on or through your flesh, making you tougher and a little rough around the edges. Literally. Game Effect: You gain 1 level of natural Armor. Your Unarmed Melee attacks inflict Physical damage.
quality.double_jointed.desc=Through practice or genetics, you’ve managed to make most of the joints in your body bend beyond normal metahuman ranges.

Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge on all tests involving grappling, escaping bonds, flexibility, or fitting into tight spaces.
quality.elemental_resistance.desc=Through genetics or training, you have developed a powerful resistance and tolerance for certain forms of damaging energy (or lack of energy, in the case of cold).

When attacked with a weapon or spell (including unarmed combat by a spirit) that does this form of damage, gain a point of Edge before making your Defense test. 
quality.exceptional_attribute.desc=Whether it’s being a powerhouse, taking a hit from a troll, holding your synthahol, ducking a fast right, holding that inside turn, selling coal in Newcastle, or making a cat look clumsy, you’re just naturally built to be better. Game Effect: Select a Physical or Mental attribute. That attribute's maximum (but not current) rank increases by 1. This quality can only be purchased once per attribute. 
quality.first_impression.desc=You know how to make an entrance and make that first meeting the best meeting. Your wit, charm, and subtle flattery put everyone you meet off their guard and let you make the most of a first encounter.

quality.hardening.desc=Get clipped by IC and other personas enough times in the Matrix, and you can start to build defenses against it. Your physical form actually helps absorb some of the injuries coming at your Matrix persona. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge when making Matrix Damage Resistance tests. If you do not use that point of Edge immediately on the Damage Resistance test, it goes away. When struck by any damage in the Matrix, you can convert up to two boxes to Stun Damage, rather than Matrix damage, protecting your persona at the cost of yourself.
quality.high_pain_tolerance.desc=Pain is but an illusion of the mind. Either that, or you were born with congenital analgesia. Either way, you don’t suffer the ill effects of injury and pain like others. Game Effect: When wounded, reduce your wound penalty by one (to a minimum of 0).
quality.home_ground.desc=Spend enough time somewhere, and you get to know it like the back of your hand. In the local neighborhood, you know every turn, every back alley, every shop on the block, the local rivalries and romances, and you can use all of it to your advantage. In the Matrix, you’ve spent countless hours in the code, you know its gremlins, its quirks, the local avatars, and the ones that are out of place. Game Effect: Select a neighborhood or Matrix host each time you take this quality. Outdoors and Perception tests made in your Home Ground gain an Edge for use on that test; if you do not use the Edge on that test, it goes away.
quality.human-looking.desc=Small orks, tall dwarfs, and ugly elves do exist. Whether through genetics or modifications, you do not look like your birth metatype; you appear human. The points in your ears are easily overlooked, your tusks are filed down to mere teeth, your cheekbones are rounder, your legs longer— that sort of thing. You can pass for human, which might help with humans or cause obstacles with non-humans. Game Effect: You generally appear human at first glance and gain +2 dice on Disguise tests to hide your metatype and appear more human. 
quality.indomitable.desc= Whether through deep studies, natural selection,or intense training, your mind is hard to break.

Game Effect: Edge Boost costs are reduced by 1 on tests involving Willpower. 
quality.juryrigger.desc=When you don’t have the time or the parts to do it right, you can still get it done. Whether it’s slapping on duct tape, twisting together wires that maybe shouldn’t be connected, or just giving the thing a swift kick, you find a creative way to get a machine working, even if only briefly. Game Effect: When performing a Juryrigging test (see p. 95), you gain a point of Edge that must be spent on that test, or it goes away.

Game Effect: You can see clearly in any light level that is not total darkness (see Environment and Visibility, p. 118). 
quality.magic_resistance.desc=You could have been born under a blood moon, filled your body with foreign substances, or had bits of your soul sucked out by a spirit or vampire. For good or ill, mana just doesn’t seem to want to connect with you. Whether it’s a manabolt trying to melt your brain, a fireball trying to cook you alive, or a healing spell trying to mend your wounds, it’s just harder to get magic to work on you. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge for use on any Magic Resistance test; if you do not use it on that test, that point goes away. When a Health spell is cast on you, treat your Essence as if it were 2 points lower than it actually is.
quality.mentor_spirit.desc=You believe in something other than yourself to help guide and channel your magic, and that something believes in you. Whether it be the totem of Wolf, the Norse god Loki, or the Christian God, you utilize your beliefs to shape and focus your arcane abilities more easily.

If you fail to keep aligned with one of those tenets, you lose your faith and connection to your mentor and all associated bonuses. 
quality.photographic_memory.desc=Most people store life in clips, but you keep the recording running all the time. It’s a ton of information to deal with at times, but it has made you great for trivia night and remembering the favorite color of your childhood friend. Game Effect: You gain a bonus Edge point when making a Memory test (p. 67). If you do not use this point of Edge on the test, it goes away.
quality.quick_healer.desc=You tend to heal from injury quicker than your peers, which is incredibly valuable in a profession that is all about putting your body on the line. Game Effect: Cut the interval for any natural healing test (p. 120) in half, meaning you can heal Stun Damage after half an hour and Physical Damage after half a day.
quality.resistance_pathogens.desc=When you claim, “I’ve never been sick a day in my life,” there’s a good chance it may be true. You have a very healthy immune system that has mastered the art of fighting off any and all comers that try to slip into your body and make you sick.
Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when you make a Pathogen Resistance test. If you do not use it on that test, it goes away.
quality.spirit_affinity.desc=You have earned respect among a particular group of spirits/sprites.

This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spirits/sprites each time.

This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spirits/sprites each time.
quality.thermographic_vision.desc=Thanks to enhancements or just genetics, your vision allows you to see differences in temperature on and around objects and people, though most of the time ambient regular light overrides the heat signature. Large local sources of heat can create a glare of sorts, but usually something giving off that much heat is also giving off light, so your regular vision takes over. Game Effect: You can see the heat of objects in total darkness (assuming they are warmer or colder than the ambient temperature), allowing you to operate in such conditions. 
quality.toughness.desc=Whether it’s mental training, a physical regimen of self-inflicted injury, or you’re just one tough bastard, you can take a bit more of a beating and shrug off the injuries better than most. Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when making Damage Resistance tests. If you do not use it on the test, it goes away.
quality.toxin_resistance.desc= Whether through naturally superior organs or because you think getting bit by a snake on a daily basis is a fun way to pass the time, you’re able to better resist the effects of toxins in the Sixth World.  Game Effect: You gain a bonus point of Edge when you make a Toxin Resistance test (p. 121). If you do not use it on that test, it goes away.
quality.will_to_live.desc= No matter how hard the hit, you have the tenacity to hold on to the bitter end. You are quite capable of taking a .50-cal round to the chest and waking up in the hospital, rather than never waking up at all. Game Effect: For every rank of this quality you possess, you gain two additional Damage Overflow boxes (see p. 121).
quality.addiction.desc=Some habits just can’t be kicked. It might be as simple as a need for a drag off that nic-stick to cool your nerves, or as life-twisting as a need for something better-than-life, but whatever it is, it’s got a firm grip on you. Game Effect: You cannot earn Edge or spend Edge in any form while suffering withdrawal. Withdrawal times (the time that passes before you need your next hit) and requirements are based on the level of addiction and can be found on the Addiction Withdrawal table.

This does not affect critical glitches, only regular glitches.
quality.bad_rep.desc=Word on the street does not speak favorably of you. Maybe you lost a team or got kicked from a team for breaking during interrogation. Whatever it is, your reputation precedes you, and never in the way you want it to. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on Social tests.

Game Effect: Your Initiative Score is divided in half at the start of combat. You cannot take a Move or Sprint action in the first round, and you act last in that round.

quality.elf_poser.desc=Your blood may be human or ork, but your ears, cheekbones, and hoity-toity attitude are all elf.

Game Effect: Elves, orks, and trolls gain a point of Edge in Influence (Etiquette) tests made against you.

If you get a 1 on either die, it means the device fails to function correctly and can be treated as a glitch. The device can be quickly reset with a Minor Action and used again.

The device is done for good and you might be in for a bit of hurt from shock or biofeedback. 
quality.honorbound.desc=You have a code. You live by the code. You die by the code. Game Effect: You cannot spend or earn Edge for twenty-four hours after you break a tenet of your code.

If a different tenet is broken, it’s twenty-four hours for that one added to any current infractions, and the same rules apply for additional violations.
quality.impaired.desc=Some folks are just not meant to be naturally talented. A bum knee, poor genetics, or an illness as a kid has you lacking the maximum achievement level of your peers. Game Effect: For each level, the character’s maximum for the chosen attribute decreases by 1, to a minimum of 2.
quality.incompetent.desc=No matter how much you practice and try to figure it out, there are some skills you just can’t manage to get right. Game Effect: When this quality is chosen, select a skill.

Each point of Karma spent also puts you 5,000 nuyen into debt with someone very dangerous and capable of collecting. You must pay a monthly interest rate of 500 nuyen per Karma spent, in addition to any payment to the principal. If the interest is not paid, the lenders come searching for you. The quality can be bought off purely with money; if the principal is repaid the quality is eliminated.
quality.insomnia.desc=Sleep? What’s that? You just can’t get a good night’s rest. Game Effect: Without proper rest, you can’t regain Edge or spend it as you might like. Each day the runner must make a Body + Willpower (3) test to get a successful night of rest. If they fail, they cannot earn more than two Edge from any source that day. Also, they cannot spend more than 2 Edge on any given test. The purchase and use of a sleep regulator reduces the threshold on the test to 1. The runner can also purchase medication (50 nuyen/dose) that reduces the threshold to 2.
quality.loss_confidence.desc=Imposter syndrome, a single traumatic failure, or just too many rejections or small failures in life ave left you doubting yourself at every turn. Game Effect: During any encounter, the runner must make a Willpower (2) test as a Minor Action. Failure means they cannot earn or spend Edge for the entire encounter.
quality.low_pain_tolerance.desc= You’ve got sensitive nerves or a generally sensitive nature. For whatever reason, you are more affected by injuries and discomfort. Game Effect: All wound modifiers are doubled.
quality.ork_poser.desc=Your blood may be human or elf, but your ears, jaw, tusks, and rough attitude are all ork. Game Effect: Elves, orks, and trolls gain a point of Edge in Influence (Etiquette) tests made against you.
quality.prejudiced.desc= You have some deep-seated views and beliefs about a certain group, and no matter what anyone says, you know they’re no good. Game Effect: Select a specific group or type of people. You are unable to gain or use Edge while the object of your prejudice is present (unless you’re directly opposing them).
quality.scorched.desc=A Matrix, simsense, or BTL experience has fried your neurons to the point of perpetual frazzle, causing trouble when you’re logged on, even when it’s just AR. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge while accessing the Matrix. This includes through use of commlinks, smartlinks, and any other source of data coming in from the ether.
quality.sensitive_system.desc=Your body does not like to have anything grafted or merged with it that isn’t part of its natural code. Game Effect: Essence costs are doubled for all cyberware, bioware, and nanoware. Geneware suffers no ill effects.
quality.simsense_vertigo.desc=Whenever you log onto the Matrix in VR, your disorientation is nauseating. Game Effect: You cannot gain or spend Edge while accessing the Matrix via VR. You also receive the Nauseated status (p. 52) for one hour after you log off the Matrix.
quality.sinner.desc= You have a legitimate SIN that links back to biometric data. You have enough attachment to it, whether for your own or family purposes, that you can’t just burn it. Game Effect: You pay taxes to the issuer of your SIN (megacorp or nation). 10 percent increase in the cost of the lifestyle associated with this SIN. You are easier to track or identify, giving opponents a point of Edge when they attempt Trace Icon action against you.
quality.social_stress.desc=Social situations that simply does not work for you, like being in large groups, talking to new people, being the center of attention. Game Effect: Select a specific social stressor. When encountering your social stressor, you must make a Charisma (2) test as a Minor Action. Failure means you cannot earn or spend Edge until you succeed. You can choose not to take the test but if so, any tests made against you gain a bonus Edge. 
quality.spirit_bane.desc=The reason doesn’t matter—what matters is the fact that a certain type of spirit/sprite has an inherent dislike for you. Game Effect: Choose a type of spirit or sprite. Spirits/sprites from that category gain a bonus point of Edge when you attempt a Conjuring or Tasking test against them. Can be taken multiple times with new class of spirits/sprites each time. In combat, spirits/sprites of the chosen type will attack you first and relentlessly, resulting in savaging a dead body or bricking a deck if they have nothing else to do.
quality.sprite_bane.desc=The reason doesn’t matter—what matters is the fact that a certain type of spirit/sprite has an inherent dislike for you. Game Effect: Choose a type of spirit or sprite. Spirits/sprites from that category gain a bonus point of Edge when you attempt a Conjuring or Tasking test against them. Can be taken multiple times with new class of spirits/sprites each time. In combat, spirits/sprites of the chosen type will attack you first and relentlessly, resulting in savaging a dead body or bricking a deck if they have nothing else to do.
quality.uncouth.desc=At some point in life, the filter between your thoughts and your mouth disappeared. You consider yourself brutally honest, but others tend to see you as rude and abrasive. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Charisma.
quality.uneducated.desc=You have a definite lack in your basic education. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Logic.
quality.unsteady_hands.desc=You can’t draw a straight line to save your life. You also have a real hard time typing, tying your shoes, and keeping a gunsight on the target. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Agility that directly involves your hands (that is, a Stealth test to pull off sleight-of-hand would directly involve the hands, as would an Attack test with any weapon held in the hands, but an Athletics test involving running would not, even though the hands are in motion while running).
quality.weak_immune_system.desc=You’re sick almost all the time. It may just be a minor cold, or it could be a nasty case of influenza or worse, but you’ve never met an infection you didn’t want to take home and hang out with for a bit. Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge to resist the effects of an infection. The threshold for fighting off any infection you are exposed to is increased by 1. While suffering the ill effects of an illness, you suffer a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests.
quality.candle_in_the_darkness.desc=Some people trust those with Code of Honor and find themselves believing. Turns out that when people see a light in the darkness, they’re drawn to it. As long as the character doesn’t break their Code of Honor, all contacts are treated as having a Loyalty 2 higher than their actual rating. If CoH is broken, the contacts are treated as having 1 Loyalty less than their rating until the mistake can be corrected.
quality.massive_network.desc=The character spends an obscene amount of time socializing, gathering friends from all rugs of society. This quality is often seen in fixers, newspaper editors, schoolteachers with two decades of graduates, and world-famous musicians—the type of people who seem to know everybody. The cost of all contacts is reduced by 2, to a minimum cost of 2. This does not stack with Networker.
quality.networker.desc=This character has an extensive social network of loose friends and casual contacts. This quality is often found in reporters, business managers, and small-time musicians who may cast a wide but shallow social net. The cost of all contacts is reduced by 1, to a minimum cost of 1.
quality.stolen_gear.desc=You went out and took what you wanted, and damn the consequences. Someone now wants their stuff back. The player and gamemaster must decide on the exact details, but the benefit is that for each point of Karma (up to 20) spent on Stolen Gear, the character gets 10,000 nuyen (see below) to spend on gear, cyberware, and/or bioware during character creation. These points are spent instead of the normal Karma for extra cash (not in addition to), and extend the possible additional funds to 150,000¥. This nuyen must be spent on gear, cyberware, or bioware. Any nuyen left over does not convert into nuyen that the character can keep. They’ll be putting a large bounty on your head (worth at least 25,000 nuyen) and sending other runners after you.
quality.returned_soldier_part1.desc=The character served in a military at some point, only to vanish off the face of the Earth for a time. They have now come back, but the experience is hazy. They have some memories of a vast city called Dis and being held in a maze-like building against their will, but other memories refuse to surface. On their return, they find their body and mind have changed, giving them new abilities. Select two powers from the list starting on p. 141 and one characteristic from the list on p. 142. (Slip Streams)
quality.returned_soldier_part2.desc=The character served in a military at some point, only to vanish off the face of the Earth for a time. They have now come back, but the experience is hazy. They have some memories of a vast city called Dis and being held in a maze-like building against their will, but other memories refuse to surface. On their return, they find their body and mind have changed, giving them new abilities. Select two powers from the list starting on p. 141 and one characteristic from the list on p. 142. (Slip Streams)
quality.returned_soldier_part3.desc=The character served in a military at some point, only to vanish off the face of the Earth for a time. They have now come back, but the experience is hazy. They have some memories of a vast city called Dis and being held in a maze-like building against their will, but other memories refuse to surface. On their return, they find their body and mind have changed, giving them new abilities. Select two powers from the list starting on p. 141 and one characteristic from the list on p. 142. (Slip Streams)
quality.innate_talent.desc=The focus and dedication that come from traveling on a way grant an adept the ability to routinely bolster their adept abilities in small ways. Once per encounter, they may reduce the costs of Edge boosts by one on any test that is modified in any way by an adept power or metamagic technique. For every level of initiation, this ability can be used one additional time per encounter.
quality.focused_channeling.desc=Adepts focused on a way may resist the hardships of using mana by relying on their way-specific training and mindset, instead of the default fortitude attributes of basic adepts. This alternate drain attribute is not mandatory, but the decision to change or not must be made when a way is gained and cannot be altered thereafter (until and unless an adept changes their way; see the Finding Your Way metamagic, p. 84). 
quality.spark_of_brilliance.desc=Finally, followers of ways receive some other minor enhancement to their magical power, as listed below, generally reflecting a greater trust in their magical ability that may prove inconsistent at times, but truly impressive when innate knacks and experience align properly. 
quality.artisans_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Logic instead of Willpower, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Biotech, Cracking, Electronics, Engineering, or Piloting (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.artists_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Charisma instead of Willpower, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Athletics, Con, or Influence (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.athletes_ways.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with any physical attribute instead of Body, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Athletics (the choice of physical attribute for drain is permanent at the time this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.beasts_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Intuition instead of Willpower. They may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Outdoors or Perception (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll), or they may choose to receive both the adept and magician benefits of their mentor spirit (purchased normally). The selection of which benefit to gain is made when the way is chosen.
quality.burnouts_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with one physical attribute modified via mundane augmentation instead of Body (the choice of which attribute is permanent when this way is taken). In addition, they may use their Innate Talent way ability (see above) one additional time per encounter for every full Essence point they are below 6.
quality.invisible_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Agility instead of Body, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Stealth or Perception (select one skill when this way is taken, but choose to include a wild die from roll to roll).
quality.magicians_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with their tradition attribute instead of Willpower, and they may either swap in a wild die on any roll made for Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, or Sorcery (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a Wild Die or not from roll to roll), or they may choose to receive both the Adept and Magician benefits of their mentor spirit (purchased normally). The selection of which benefit to gain is made when the way is chosen.
quality.speakers_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with Charisma instead of Willpower, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Con or Influence (the choice of one skill is permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.warriors_way.desc=Followers may resist adept drain with any physical attribute instead of Body, and they may swap in a wild die on any roll made for Close Combat or Firearms (the choice of which drain attribute to use and the choice of which skill for wild die manipulation are both permanent when this way is taken, but you may choose to include a wild die or not from roll to roll).
quality.always_late.desc=It doesn’t matter how many alarms you set or how many times your teammates call you to remind you; whether you’re constantly distracted or can’t drag yourself out of bed, you cannot show up anywhere on time to save your life. Game Effects: You always arrive at least fifteen minutes late for any scheduled event. When the event in question includes a meeting with a prospective employer, your entire team suffers a –1 penalty to social tests against Mr. Johnson due to your unprofessional behavior.
quality.bad_memories.desc=You can’t enjoy all those trids where the main character “faces their inner demons,” because they hit a little too close to home. Some nasty drek happened in the past, and it’s lurking around even today, popping up when you least expect it—and at the least convenient times. Game Effect: When you take (or are assigned) this quality, choose a subject of your Bad Memories. Whenever you’re required to be in the presence of that subject, you may only gain a maximum of one point of Edge per combat round, instead of the usual two.
quality.compulsion.desc=Some people alleviate their suffering by stuffing themselves to the gills with illicit substances. You’ve chosen another way: a behavior you can’t help but indulge in, that’s less poisonous but equally toxic. This can represent anything from psychological addictions like gambling or Matrix gaming to “obsessive-compulsive” behaviors like arranging items in a certain order or repetitive handwashing. Game Effect: You must indulge in your chosen activity for a specified amount of time per day, depending on the level of the quality. Failing to do so results in you suffering withdrawal, inflicting a –2 dice pool penalty on all tests, increasing by 1 with each withdrawal period that elapses. As with the Addiction quality, you cannot earn Edge or spend Edge in any form while suffering withdrawal. However, like the modified Addiction quality described above, characters do not suffer the effects of the Anxiety, Depression, or Paranoia negative qualities while indulging their compulsion.
quality.flashbacks.desc=You haven’t been able to leave behind the effects of a trauma you experienced, to the point where certain triggers make you relive the whole experience. Game Effect: When selecting this quality, choose a specific event that is the subject of the flashbacks. At least one, and possibly more, specific triggers should be identified. This should be multi-sensory and specific, so that it is not invoked regularly. When the character is subjected to the trigger, they must make a Composure (4) test or enter into a flashback. The flashback lasts three minutes. When the flashback starts, the character rolls a Composure (3) test; if they succeed, they recognize that they are in a flashback, and they are able to endure it. They receive a –4 dice pool penalty to any test involving Physical attributes for the duration. If they fail the second test, they cannot do anything but react to the flashback.
quality.maybe_you_missed_something.desc=With threats lurking everywhere, the only person you trust to spot danger is yourself, even if you’re not always the best person for the job. Game Effect: Whenever you’re in a potentially dangerous situation, you must take any feasible steps to search out potential threats. If another member of the team has already done so, you must spend at least as much time as they did completing the same task, with all the exasperation that entails (like the decker chewing out the street samurai for “checking their work”).
quality.phobia_common.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.phobia_uncommon.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.phobia_rare.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.phobia_very_rare.desc=You have an immediate negative reaction to a certain object, thing, or phenomenon, to the point that you will do whatever is in your power to avoid the thing in question. Game Effect: You will never willingly go near the subject of your phobia, and if you are compelled to be near it, you cannot gain or spend Edge, and you experience a –2 dice pool modifier to any test besides Damage Resistance tests while the Phobia is in effect. You also must make a Composure(3) test every 5 minutes or else shut down entirely, making you curl into a ball.
quality.pacifist.desc=You are one of the few people remaining in the Sixth World who not only believes that violence isn’t the answer, but who actively tries to avoid violence whenever possible— even against people who get so fed up with your peaceful ways that they want to smack you. This quality may not be taken together with the White Hat version of the Honorbound quality, but may be taken with other versions of the Honorbound Quality at the gamemaster’s discretion. (We recommend that this quality and the Honorbound quality be taken together when this quality would impose a more severe limitation than the Honorbound quality alone would.) As the name implies, this quality limits the ways in which a character may use violence against other characters. If the character knowingly acts against their pacifist beliefs, they may not spend or earn Edge for twenty-four hours after committing the violent act. Any violent act committed during that twenty-four hours extends the duration of not being able to spend or regain Edge by another 24 hours. Level 1: You may only initiate violence (i.e., act in a way that results in damage being inflicted on a target) to stop a clear, imminent threat to another character, such as a hostile NPC aiming a weapon at them. You may take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage on a target, but only if they could reasonably survive the damage inflicted. Level 2: You may not initiate violence under any circumstances, but you may attack targets who have already proven themselves to be a threat to you or others. You may take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage to a target, but only if they could reasonably survive the damage inflicted. Level 3: You may not initiate violence under any circumstances, but you may attack targets who have already proven themselves to be a threat to you or others. You may not knowingly take actions that would result in inflicting Physical damage to a target, but you may still take actions that would result in inflicting Stun damage to a target. Level 4: You may not knowingly commit a violent act for any reason, even in defense of yourself or others.
quality.arcane_resilience_training.desc=Students of magic learn the standard techniques of their tradition to resist the exhaustion that kicks in after using their arcane powers. However, some teachers provide routines that cater to the individual needs of their students and help them to reduce the tiring effects of magic more effectively. Game Effect: Magicians may define Logic, Intuition, or Charisma as their new tradition Attribute, using that attribute in all drain resistance tests.
quality.scholastic_mage.desc=A considerable share of mages—especially in the hermetic traditions—do not undergo training with a personal teacher but attend university classes instead. Granted, an academic education costs a considerable amount of money, logic tradition qualities but it certainly pays off in terms of mediated knowledge. Game Effect: During character creation only, mages can buy Knowledge Skills for 2 Karma each. They can also buy Knowledge skills with their starting nuyen (p. 68, SR6) at a cost of 1,000 nuyen per Knowledge skill. This quality can be combined with the In Debt quality; however, this raises the cost per Knowledge skill to 2,000 nuyen.
quality.shamanic_mask.desc=Some magicians channel their arcane powers through their mentor spirit. In turn, as part of their action, the totem begins to manifest itself through a visible, temporary transformation (animalistic features, elemental effects, etc.). The transformation is mana-based, so only living beings catch the transformation. The more successes in the magic test, the more pronounced the transformation and the more identifiable the totem is to even the mundane. Game Effect: The mage defines one effect (e.g., a translucent wolf’s face covering their features, their eyes glowing in arcane fire). This effect accompanies the use of any skill involving magic (or for adepts, every activation of an adept power). Investing a Minor Action (in addition to the action required in using the corresponding magical skill), the magician gains one Edge. This Edge is only temporary and can only be used for the test (Adepts: for the first test involving the activated Adept power). There’s a downside, too: the Shamanic Mask inevitably exposes the mage as Awakened. This may draw the enemies’ fire towards them, putting them in mortal danger.
quality.pusillanimous_summoner.desc=Be it because of an unpleasant experience in the past, or the peculiarities of their arcane upbringing — whenever summoning a spirit, the magician is stricken with awe. Sensing the discomfort, the spirit gains the upper hand and tends to execute the conjurer’s demands precisely by the word — no more, but, if it feels like it, considerably less. (Along the way, the spirit will display either a very twisty or snotty behavior, depending on the magician’s tradition.) A pusillanimous summoner has to be very precise about their wording, unless they don’t mind being given the runaround by the spirit. This quality can only be taken by characters who qualify for the Conjuring skill. Game Effect: Spirits summoned by the magician try their best to misinterpret the summoner’s orders (at the gamemaster’s discretion). If the magician wants to be sure there are no loopholes in their instructions, they have to sit down before the conjuring and perform a Conjuring + Intuition (8, 5 mins) Extended test to think those instructions through.
quality.possession_tradition.desc=The conjurer has never learned to summon spirits in a way that allows them to manifest in the physical realm, or, for some reason, consciously abstains from doing so. This quality can only be taken by characters who qualify for the Conjuring skill. Game Effect: Spirits summoned in this tradition have their Materialization power replaced with the Possession power (p. 69).
quality.representation1.desc=Some arcane teachers offer their students auxiliary techniques, called representations, to support their learning. While many students, becoming more and more confident, overcome those techniques little by little, others decide to maintain them, finding them comforting and helpful. This quality is not available for adepts. Game Effect: The magician defines a clearly visible or audible act—gestures, spoken words, chants, and the like—that must be performed whenever they use arcane powers; alternatively, there’s a special garb or outfit (or even the total lack of any textiles) that must be worn. The act or garb can’t be casual or misinterpretable (e.g., as colloquial clothing or a fashion statement) but should raise suspicions, even with mundane people, that something mojo-related is going on.  In the quality’s simple form (I), the magician can abstain from using their representation, but they have to accept a –4 dice pool penalty on all Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, and Sorcery rolls when not wearing the representation. Another drawback of this quality is that it points out to the magician’s enemies that they are the “dangerous one,” and if the enemies follow the old credo “kill the mage first,” this puts the magician in mortal danger. Along with all those downsides comes an upside; once per day, when the magician uses their representation while using arcane powers, they gain one point of situational Edge that can only be spent for that test.
quality.representation2.desc=Some arcane teachers offer their students auxiliary techniques, called representations, to support their learning. While many students, becoming more and more confident, overcome those techniques little by little, others decide to maintain them, finding them comforting and helpful. This quality is not available for adepts. Game Effect: The magician defines a clearly visible or audible act—gestures, spoken words, chants, and the like—that must be performed whenever they use arcane powers; alternatively, there’s a special garb or outfit (or even the total lack of any textiles) that must be worn. The act or garb can’t be casual or misinterpretable (e.g., as colloquial clothing or a fashion statement) but should raise suspicions, even with mundane people, that something mojo-related is going on. In its more pronounced form (II), if the magician is unable to use their representation (e.g., because they are gagged, hands are tied, or the garb is removed), they are effectively hindered from performing any magic and cannot use the Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, and Sorcery skills. Another drawback of this quality is that it points out to the magician’s enemies that they are the “dangerous one,” and if the enemies follow the old credo “kill the mage first,” this puts the magician in mortal danger. Along with all those downsides comes an upside; once per day, when the magician uses their representation while using arcane powers, they gain one point of situational Edge that can only be spent for that test.
action.reroll_one.desc=Pick any die and reroll it. It can be yours or your opponent’s, but the result stands no matter what you roll. This is done after all rolls have been made. 
action.plus_3_ini.desc=This one kicks in before combat even starts. You can choose to spend one point of Edge to increase your Initiative Score by 3. It can also be used during the fight if you want to move up in the order on the next Initiative Cycle.
action.plus_1_roll.desc=You get to add 1 to a single die. Maybe that’s making a 4 a 5 to get another hit, or making 1 a 2 to avoid a glitch.
action.give_ally_1_edge.desc=You do something that offers an advantage for another member of your team. Take away two of your own Edge, and give one to a teammate.
action.negate_1_edge.desc=No sense in letting the bad guys get the best of you if you don’t need to. You spend two of your own Edge, but one vanishes from the opponent of your choice. 
action.buy_auto_hit.desc=You get an automatic hit. This one adds on to the total hits you roll. This isn’t an automatic success at whatever test you’re attempting, just another hit to add to your total.
action.heal_1_stun.desc=You catch a second wind and clear a box from your Stun Condition Monitor.
action.add_edge_pool.desc=Add your Edge as a dice pool bonus to your roll, and make 6s explode. “Exploding” means that 6s count as a hit and can be rerolled in an attempt to get an additional hit. If another hit is scored,tack it on; if another 6 is rolled, tack on a hit and roll it again. Keep the hits coming! If a 1 is rolled after a 6, it does not count toward your total for calculating glitches.
action.heal_1_physic.desc=You take off a single box of damage from your Physical Condition Monitor—your advantage over your opponents means they didn’t hit you quite as hard as they first thought.
action.reroll_failed.desc=Pretty much what it says—after a roll is made, you can reroll all failed dice. This Edge Boost cannot be used if a glitch or critical glitch is rolled.
action.count_2_glitch.desc=Time to get counteroffensive! When an opponent rolls, both 1s and 2s count in their total to determine if they glitch or critical glitch.
action.create_special.desc=Bring your creativity to the table! You spend this Edge and something fortuitous happens. It’s up to you and your gamemaster to determine what it is, but it should certainly turn the tides slightly in your favor. Burst pipes, approaching sirens, incoming DocWagon, an angry spirit, something that adds a little more oomph to your side or puts a little stress on the enemy.
action.anticipation.desc=For you combat is like a game of chess, and you’re several moves ahead of the opposition. When performing this Multiple Attack, double your full dice pool and then split it as evenly as possible for each different target. Cost: 4 Edge
action.big_speech.desc=A torrent of words flows from your mouth, reaching heights of eloquence and inspiration mortals rarely hit. Roll your Influence + Charisma test twice; the first time it counts as a Teamwork test, meaning you can add your hits to the dice pool for the second roll. The second roll acts as your hits for the test.
action.bring_the_drama.desc=While spinning your con, you get to a part where extra drama would be appropriate, and you bring it. Maybe it’s a dramatic speech, maybe it’s some tears or sorrowful histrionics, but whatever the case, you take action to tug at the heartstrings of the mark and bring them to your side. For a quick con, this can bring in 200 nuyen from onlookers. When used as part of a longer-term con, you can increase your asking price by twenty percent, and the mark will agree to it. 
action.called_shot_disarm.desc=Successful hit does no damage to target, but their weapon is knocked from their hands.
action.called_shot_vitals.desc=The attack goes for the vitals, adding 3 extra damage if  it hits (along with net hits, as usual).
action.fire_from_cover.desc=(Ranged Attack, must be in Cover IV): You sneak an attack out while maintaining your cover. Attacks from cover may be made without spending a Minor Action.
action.knockout_blow.desc=You use your advantage to truly bring the hurt on an opponent. If your inflicted damage of any type is greater than the target’s Willpower, immediately fill up the Stun Condition Monitor. The target is unconscious. No damage overflows to the Physical Condition Monitor.
action.shank.desc=When attacking with a blade, your advantage turns into a targeted strike. Reduce the Call a Shot penalty to –2.
action.sudden_insight.desc=Perform an action in which you have no skill levels without penalty. This does not allow you to use skills that cannot be performed untrained. Cost:
action.tactical_roll_htd.desc=You drop to avoid incoming fire, with an agile roll that helps you make an attack as you roll. If you use a melee Attack action on the same combat round, you do not get the dice pool penalty that comes with the Prone status (p. 53) or Hit the Dirt Action (p. 41). For the next round, you do not take the –2 dice pool penalty from Close or Near attacks that come with the Prone status.
action.tumble.desc=Your advantages combine to give you the chance to not just hurt your opponent but bring them to the ground. If the damage being inflicted on a target is greater than the target’s Body, they are brought down, giving them the Prone status.
action.wrest.desc=When in melee combat, if you successfully Block an attack, you can use this action to wrest your opponent’s weapon away. Roll Close Combat + Agility, with the attacker’s Strength as the threshold. If you equal the threshold, you knock the weapon out of their hands, and it falls to the ground. If you get more hits, you take the weapon from them. If you get fewer hits, the attacker retains the weapon.
action.i_saw_it_in_a_trid_once.desc=A character may use any martial arts technique they haven’t spent Karma to learn as part of their next action. This use of Edge may not have its cost reduced by martial arts techniques the user has already spent Karma to learn.
action.recover.desc=You spend a Major Action to recover from one debilitating status effect during this encounter or reduce the effect by 1 if it has multiple levels.
action.blinding_strike.desc=(Any Attack, Blind) This special attack goes after the eyes of opponents. This can be as direct as an eye gouge or indirect, like cutting the face near the eyes so that blood impedes vision. If net hits on an attack roll are higher than the Agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Blind I status. This status adds more levels of Blind if the opponent already had that status. Duration of the inflicted status is a number of combat rounds equal the net hits on the attack. No other damage occurs from the attack.
action.called_shot_break_weapon.desc= Break Weapon (Any Attack) If you can’t disarm your opponent, or you just want to show off, you can direct your attack against your opponent’s weapon to disable it. The Attack roll is the similar to breaking through barriers (p. 111, SR6). If the modified DV exceeds half of the Structure rating for the weapon (see Weapon Structure Ratings table) corresponding to the weapon, the Attack Rating of the weapon is reduced by 1 permanently in all range categories. If the DV exceeds the Structure rating, reduce the Attack Rating by the difference between DV and the Structure rating. If the Attack Rating is reduced to 0 in a range category, the weapon cannot be used at that distance (p. 109, SR6). If there is no Attack Rating available in any range category, it’s time to buy a new one, as this one’s busted.
action.called_shot_incapacitate.desc= Incapacitate (Any Attack) If you can’t take your opponent in a fair fight, try inflicting a concussion first. With this called shot, if the number of net hits exceeds the Reaction attribute of the target, that character receives the Dazed status with a duration of a number of combat rounds equal to the net hits.
action.charge.desc=(Melee Attack, Move Action) You throw yourself body and soul into the attack, hoping to bring both the pain and some staggering power. After moving at least 5 meters, you make the attack against your opponent. Net hits can be transferred from damage to movement; for each point transferred, the damage is reduced by one, and the opponent is moved one meter. The attacker can transfer damage in an amount equal to or less than their Body rating. If the attack damages the opponent, calculate the possibility of knocking the opponent prone as if the damage value was 2 higher than it was after the transfer.
action.cover_fire.desc=(BF or FA Attack) To put it simply, you spray a whole lot of bullets in the direction of your opponent to put them in an inconvenient position that your allies take advantage of as a kind of Cover. Your firearm must be firing in Burst Fire or Full Auto mode. When using Burst Fire, instead of increasing the DV of the weapon by 1 against the two opponents, you give two allies a +2 to Cover (up to Cover IV) if the targeted opponents retaliate. With Full Auto, reduce the DV of the weapon by 2 and your allies receive Cover IV in relation to opponents that are targeted. 
action.entanglement.desc=(Grapple Attack with Exotic Weapon) Exotic weapons such as whips, chains, bolos, and lariats have the capabilities of entangling an opponent. When used as part of grapple, roll Exotic Weapon + Agility vs. Agility + Reaction. If net hits of the attack exceed the opponent’s Agility, the weapon has entangled the opponent, and they gain the Hobbled status for a number of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits.
action.fake_out.desc=(Any Attack) Your strategy in this attack is not to kill or maim, but to distract, putting your opponent off balance or giving them a false feeling of success that puts them at a disadvantage when they take the bait. Roll an attack against the opponent. Instead of doing damage, net hits lower the opponent’s Defense Rating for the next combat round on a one-to-one basis (the weapon’s DV has no effect). This new Defense Rating is used by any attacker targeting this individual.
action.freerunning.desc=(Sprint) Through a series of gymnastic maneuvers, the character can move quickly through and up terrain obstacles. This Edge Action allows both horizontal and vertical movement in one Major Action (instead of multiple Minor Actions). While sprinting, the character can remove hits from the Sprint action and use them to gain vertical distance (climbing both up and down), up to their Agility in meters. Movement with Parkour must end on a horizontal surface (or foothold/handhold), otherwise you fall down. The gamemaster determines if there is enough terrain to ascend or descend vertically and if there’s a foothold or handhold. An adept with Wall Running ability who uses the Freeruning Action increases their base Sprint distance to 18 meters.
action.hamstring.desc=(Any Attack) This action covers any attack aimed at the hamstring, knee, or other parts of the leg with the express purpose of slowing down an opponent. With the attack roll, if net successes exceed the agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Hobbled status with a duration of combat rounds equal to the number of net hits. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.imposing_stone.desc=(Intercept) Imposing Stone allows the character not only to intercept the opponent, but to prevent them from moving past them. Each success reduces the opponent’s movement by 1 meter. If the attack exceeds the opponent’s Agility, then the opponent stops next to the character.
action.intimidating_presence.desc=(Use Skill (Influence)) Sometimes, you just want to stand tall, flex some muscles, and speak in a commanding voice instead of having to shiv another round of gangers in the gut. Intimidating Presence can let punks know that you’re not to be messed with. To use it, a character rolls Influence + Strength vs. Willpower + Strength; net hits reduce opponents’ Attack Rating for that combat round on a one-to-one basis. If net hits exceed the opponent’s Attack Rating value, then the opponent cannot gain or spend Edge for the entire subsequent combat round.
action.karmic_escape.desc=(Dodge) It’s not the incoming damage that’s worrying. It’s what it can do to your DocWagon premium. To use this action, characters must have attempted to dodge or block an attack that could inflict a status (Blind, Deafened, etc.) and failed. The character can then spend Edge and a Minor Action to attempt to avoid the status they would have received, at the cost of taking damage. Resolve the attack as if the net hits did damage rather than inflicting the status.
action.knuckle_breaker.desc=(Any attack) As the name suggests, the attack is designed to neutralize the opponent’s effectiveness in combat or ability to escape. Character targets a specific limb (left leg, right arm, etc.). This called shot has a –4 dice pool penalty. If the attack is successful, that limb takes on Disabled status (see p. 106). If the net hits exceed the Body of the opponent, the limb takes on Disabled II status. The status lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to net hits. This attack can be repeated on the same limb to increase the Disabled status level (up to DisabledIII). With every attack, the duration is cumulative.
action.leaf_on_the_wind.desc=(Sprint) Through a series of gymnastic maneuvers, the character takes advantage of the surrounding terrain, doing things like moving to give a smaller or obscured profile to attack, sliding through railings, flipping over benches, getting hang time off a room corner, or whatever other creative move they can come up with. While sprinting, the character can remove successes from the Sprint action and use them as cover, up to a status of Cover IV, lasting one combat round. Treat additional actions as if they performed in Cover, including gaining and using Edge. The gamemaster determines if there is enough terrain to gain the Cover status. The Wall Running adept ability gives Cover I status automatically when using this action, as no one expects you to run up the freaking wall to escape. 
action.monkey_climb.desc=(Climb) You are not one to keep your feet on the ground. There’s a missing bit of fear as you cross empty air, going from handhold to handhold, barely looking to see if you’re arriving anywhere safe. Change climb distance to 1.2 meters per hit (characters with Long Reach increase the distance to 1.3 meters).
action.pin.desc=(Thrown Weapon or Projectile Weapon Attack) You’ve probably seen an action scene where a target is pinned to the wall with an arrow or knife or something to immobilize an opponent. This isn’t easy, in part because it’s more instinctive to aim for vital areas. With this attack, if the number of hits exceeded the Defense Rating of the target, regardless if whether attack inflicted actual any damage or not, then the opponent has been pinned to the wall or floor, giving them the Immobilized status. The opponent must spend a Pick Up/Put Down Object action to remove the Immobilized status.
action.playing_possum.desc=(Use Skill (Influence)) You are not quite dead yet, but you want to bluff your opponent into thinking you are done for or are more injured than you actually are. The character rolls Influence + Charisma vs. Willpower + Intuition. The gamemaster may include a dice pool adjustment for the believability of the particular circumstances. If successful, the character gains a dice pool bonus equal to net hits for the next attack against the opponent. If the character fails to bluff their opponent, the opponent gains a dice pool bonus equal to their net hits on their defense test. The gamemaster can wait to reveal whether the Playing Possum action succeeded or failed until the subsequent attack is made.
action.protect_the_principal.desc=(Intercept) Self-sacrifice is sometimes necessary in getting the job done. If you can move to an ally in 1 Minor Action, then you take the damage from the opponent instead of the ally. There is no option to block or dodge this attack.
action.right_back_at_ya.desc=(Avoid incoming) In an almost insane attempt at survival, this action has you grabbing a live grenade and trying to throwing it away. Avoid Incoming puts you at ground zero of the grenade attack. You then spend a Pickup action and roll Athletics + Reaction (2) to attempt to knock the grenade away. Net hits are subtracted from scatter distance of the original throw as you attempt to send it back where it came from. The gamemaster then re-rolls the scatter direction.
action.riposte.desc=(Block) This action allows the character to not only attempt to block an attack but possibly give a little damage back. First, the expenditure of Edge allows the character to decrease the base damage by 2P. If their Defense test is successful, the attacker is hit with damage equal to the net hits on the Defense test.
action.rolling_clouds.desc=(Falling) If you’re lucky enough (relatively speaking) to fall next to terrain such as a wall, cliff, or trees that you can reach, you may attempt to leverage kinetic forces to slow down your fall to something less than terminal. With an Athletics + Agility test, each success extends the number of meters that you can fall without suffering damage. For example, if you fall 15 meters and roll 3 hits, you get the base 3 meters of safe falling plus 3 more safe meters from Rolling Clouds, meaning the damaging part of your fall is 9 meters, making the damage 4P instead of 6P. 
action.rooted.desc=(Move) When someone tries to knock you down, you have the quick sense to adjust your center of gravity to cancel out the force that’s knocking you to the ground. The character rolls Agility + Athletics and adds their hits to their Body rating for purposes of checking if they are knocked down (p. 110, SR6) or against a Trip or Tumble (p. 43, SR6).
action.sucker_punch.desc=(Any Melee Attack, Fatigued) This is all about playing outside Queensbury rules, unleashing a sucker punch to get that first hit in before the opponent is ready, or some other form of dirty fighting. With the attack roll, if net hits exceed the Willpower of the opponent, the opponent gains the Fatigued status with a duration of a number of combat rounds equal to net hits. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.taunt.desc=(Use Skill (Influence)) Someone is always going to pick on the mage first. There are even slogans about it. If it’s your mage, then you need to get the pressure off them. One option is to suggest that the opponent to pick on someone their own size. A successful taunt will get into the opponent’s head and distract them from beating said mage, or goad them into some other action. A character can taunt an opponent with Influence + Charisma vs. Willpower + Intuition test. Net hits increase the Defense Rating of the ally against that opponent for one combat round. 
action.threatening_edge.desc=(Block) The fast-spinning whirl of a staff, the flash of a half-meter of shiny metal, even the sound of a massive object moving through the air, knowing that it can easily crush bones, can be psychologically intimidating even for those not close by or holding a gun. No one wants to be the next target. The character includes a weapon performance as part of combat, giving opponents something to think about. For the duration of the encounter, while wielding a melee weapon, the character’s Defense Rating is replaced by the Close Attack Rating of the weapon.
action.throat_strike.desc=(Any melee attack) A good strike when you just want your opponent to shut the hell up with the descriptive expletives and just fight. With the attack roll, if net successes exceed the agility of the opponent, the opponent gains the Muted status (p. 106). Duration of the inflicted status is equal the number of net hits in combat rounds. No damage occurs from the attack. 
action.throw_person.desc=(Grapple) Once the opponent has been grappled, the attacker may pick up the opponent. The attacker makes a Close Combat + Strength vs. Strength + Reaction test. The attacker’s unarmed Attack Rating is used, and the defender suffers the –4 dice pool penalty for being restrained. If the attack is successful, the attacker inflicts their unarmed combat damage (Strength/2, rounded up) plus net hits. The character can remove successes from the combat damage and use them for distance thrown, up to Strength/2 meters. After the throw, the opponent is out of the grapple and gains the Prone status. The gamemaster can impose additional damage to the thrown character based on where they land (onto a bed of nails, out a window of a skyscraper, down an elevator shaft, etc.).
action.thunder_palm.desc=(Any Attack) A quick strike to the ears, and the opponent will be left unable to hear that awesome retort you just came up with. If net hits exceed the Willpower of the opponent, the opponent gains the Deafened status with a duration of a number of Combat Rounds equal the number of net hits. No damage occurs from the attack.
action.tuck_and_roll.desc=(Character receives Pron status) You’re already going down from some attack (any attack that ended with the character prone), so you might as well hit the ground on your own terms. You may move up to 1 meter from the original location where you were going to be lying (which may put you at a different range category from the opponent or closer to cover). You are still prone, and the Prone status still applies.
action.weapon_flash.desc=(Quick Draw, Attack) This Edge Action allows the Quick Draw Action to be applied to any melee weapon. The Attack Action must be used in conjunction with this action.
action.weapon_spread.desc=For the duration of the encounter, while wielding two melee weapons, Close range is extended by 2 meters.
action.yielding_force.desc=(Trip) Instead of using force to counter force, you attempt to leverage the force and momentum of the attacker and knock them off balance. Instead of blocking the attack, the defender bends out of the way, throwing the opponent off balance—and hopefully on the ground. Character rolls Athletics + Agility as the defense test against the attack. If net hits exceed the Agility of the opponent, then the character takes no damage, and the opponent receives the Prone status. Otherwise, resolve as if the character was dodging.
action.emergency_boost.desc=Temporarily increase a Matrix attribute by 1 for one test.
action.hog.desc=Blast a host or persona with recursive requests, eating up valuable resources and lowering its Data Processing by 2 and active program slots by 1 for (Attack Rating) rounds.
action.signal_scream.desc=The next action ignores any penalty from noise.
action.technobabble.desc=Can only be used by technomancers. Use Charisma instead of Logic on the next Matrix action.
action.under_the_radar.desc=The next illegal action performed on this turn does not increase OS. That does not mean the action and any subsequent actions automatically become legal—it just means the OS does not increase.
item.autovoice.desc=The concept of a cyber-augmented throat has been around for decades and is present in some highly illegal hardware that allowed for voice modulators to be used to duplicate other people’s voiceprints. Amore musical-aligned (and legal) version has been around since the early ’70s. Known as “AutoVoice,” it led to a brief flurry of cybernetic-voiced artists who, before the addition, couldn’t carry a tune. Used at a normal setting, the AutoVoice controls airflow through the voice box, and the voice box’s own vibrations, to hit and hold notes as needed. With some software tweaks, this can be turned into a more mechanical sound (creating that distinct AutoVoiced sound of a few years back) or used to pitch the user’s voice up or down but still recognizable only as their own. AutoVoice replaces the user’s own limit for singing performances with its rating. Wireless: The AutoVoice allows the user to broadcast to a local audio network without a mic.
item.autovoice_hacked.desc=The concept of a cyber-augmented throat has been around for decades and is present in some highly illegal hardware that allowed for voice modulators to be used to duplicate other people’s voiceprints. Amore musical-aligned (and legal) version has been around since the early ’70s.

With some software tweaks, this can be turned into a more mechanical sound (creating that distinct AutoVoiced sound of a few years back) or used to pitch the user’s voice up or down but still recognizable only as their own. Software hacks to allow more illegal operation now circle the Shadownet. AutoVoice replaces the user’s own limit for singing performances with its rating. Wireless: The AutoVoice allows the user to broadcast to a local audio network without a mic.
item.control_rig.desc=This implant harnesses the raw data-coordinating and synchronization power of the middle brain for the express purpose of directly manipulating rigged vehicles and drones (and other devices with rigger interface, like turrets). It has a built-in sim module, allowing DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable that functions like a datajack. When you’re jumped in it provides its rating as a dice pool bonus on and reduction in threshold to all tests involving the operation of vehicle, and a bonus point of Edge.
item.cortex_kink_bomb.desc=An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs. Kink bombs are designed to damage only part of the victim’s head, either rendering specific headware useless or damaging the brain to cause blindness, stuttering, hearing loss, or some other trauma (5P, resisted with Body; status as appropriate). Of course, sometimes when something in your head explodes, things don’t go exactly as planned and the result is a bit … much. The bombs can be remote-or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to destroy specific components (kink).
item.cortex_microbomb.desc=An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs. The microbomb version is just powerful enough to kill the unfortunate bearer (18P, resisted with Body). The bombs can be remote- or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to destroy the entire limb (regular).
item.cortex_area_bomb.desc=An illegal method of coercion, cranial bombs. Area cranial bombs kill the victim (microbomb damage to victim, 18P, resisted with Body), and they also affect a blast area exactly like a fragmentation grenade (p. 263) resisted separately from the initial microbomb damage. The bombs can be remote or time-detonated, or even set to discharge by sound recognition. If installed in cyberlimbs, these bombs are designed to blast the area and damage the bearer (microbomb).
item.cyberjack1.desc=D/F: 4/3; Dice Bonus: +1; As the Matrix protocols have become stiffer and stiffer, work has raced forward to keep hackers operating. The latest tool that has advanced quickly from neat to necessary is the cyberjack, which represents one of those times when shadowrunners turned the tables on the corps. Based on corporate research on technomancers, the cyberjack harnesses the immense processing power of the brain to take on Matrix protocols and encryption schemes. It happened rapidly, but it now seems that a decker without a cyberjack is about as effective as one without a cyberdeck. The cyberjack provides a decker’s primary defense against hacking, offering Data Processing and Firewall ratings that cyberdecks no longer possess, and they also function as a standard datajack. Cyberjacks also allow special Matrix Edge Actions (p. 175).
item.cyberjack2.desc=D/F: 5/4; Dice Bonus: +1; As the Matrix protocols have become stiffer and stiffer, work has raced forward to keep hackers operating.

item.datajack.desc=A datajack gives you a direct neural interface. It also comes with a retractable spool of micro-cable (a meter long) that lets you directly interface with any electronic device via a universal access cable. Datajacks are equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or saving files. Two datajack users can string a fiberoptic cable between themselves to conduct a private mental communication immune to radio interception or eavesdropping.
item.datalock.desc=This special datajack is popular with couriers, spies, diplomatic aids, and executive liaisons. Effectively, it turns the character in whom it is installed into a walking data safe. The datalock has a Device Rating equal to its own rating, and it protects the data from anyone not authorized to access it (possibly including you). Datalocks are not wireless enabled; they can only be accessed via universal data connector. In fact, the bearer of the implant doesn’t have mental access to the data — they’re only a carrier.
item.olfactory_booster.desc= This cybersnout enhances, identifies, and records smells, and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a whole new world of sensory data to you—you’ll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scenthound would. You can smell people’s emotions in their sweat (and if applicable, the maker’s mark of their tailored pheromones), traces of ammunition propellant, explosives, or biological and chemical warfare compounds—the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odors, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. The olfactory booster can even be used in VR to create an even more immersive experience. The user gains a bonus Edge for all scent-based Perception tests, but it goes away if they do not use it on that test.
item.simrig.desc=An implanted version of the simrig described on p. 268, this headware implant allows you to record sensory data for later replay (or sale if you live a really interesting life).
item.skilljack.desc=This headware interprets knowsofts and linguasofts for your brain so you can use them as though they were your own. It can also run activesofts, but they only act as Knowledge Skills unless you have skillwires (p. 287). The total of all skills running on a skilljack cannot exceed its rating x 2, and the maximum rating for a single skill is the skilljack’s rating. Starting skills from storage and stopping skills doesn’t require an action. You can’t use Edge with skills you have through a skilljack.
item.taste_booster.desc=The taste booster performs the same function as the olfactory booster, except that it enhances your taste buds. The taste booster also lets you experience gustatory data in AR and VR environments with a “taste track”—caveat emptor on that one, chummer. The user gains a bonus Edge for all taste-based Perception tests, but it goes away if they do not use it on that test.
item.tooth_compartment.desc=The oldest cyberware on the market, these hollow teeth come in storage and breakable models. The storage model is used to smuggle really, really tiny contraband, no larger than five millimeters on a side. Items can be removed with a wireless signal or hidden catch. The breakable model triggers a linked effect (such as starting a tracking signal or releasing deadly poison into your mouth—make sure you remember which is which!) with a wireless signal, or it may trigger when you bite down hard on the tooth.
item.ultrasound_sensor.desc=This cyberware is exactly like the ultrasound sensor. When active, it replaces your normal vision. It can be switched between active sonar, passive sonar, and off with a Minor Action.
item.voice_modulator.desc=This implant gives you perfect pitch and enormous vocal flexibility and distortion capabilities. You can speak with an increased volume (up to one hundred decibels) without strain, shift your pitch to make perfect bird calls or mellifluous singing, and most importantly, uncanny vocal impressions. The modulator can also play back (and more or less perfectly imitate) a recorded or captured voice. The user gains a bonus Edge for sound-based Con skill tests. 
item.cybereye1.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.cybereye2.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.cybereye3.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.cybereye4.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.cybereye5.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.cybereye6.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.cybereye7.desc=The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera, as well as Capacity for vision enhancements.
item.flare_compensation.desc=An implanted version of the flare compensation enhancement (p. 275).
item.image_link.desc=An implanted version of the image link enhancement (p. 275).
item.low_light_vision.desc=An implanted version of the low-light vision enhancement (p. 275).
item.ocular_drone.desc=This enhancement only affects one eyeball per purchase. A small drone (treat it as a Horizon Flying Eye, p. 299) is placed in your ocular cavity. The spyball functions as a normal cybereye (with all the relevant enhancements) until you remove it and control it as though it were a drone. When it’s out, you have only one eye and suffer the Blindness I Status effect for all tasks. If you replace both eyes with drones, you gain the Blindness III Status Effect while those drones are operating apart from you. An ocular drone is obviously a fake eye.
item.retinal_duplication.desc=This highly illegal modification can be loaded with a recording of someone else’s retina to create an almost perfect reproduction. Make an Opposed test between the retinal duplication rating and the retinal scanner rating (Sensors and Scanners, p. 241). The system can actively store a number of retinas equal to its rating. Changing retinal patterns requires 1 minute.
item.smartlink.desc=An implanted version of the smartlink vision enhancement (p. 275). This is the vision accessory side of the smartgun system (p. 260). The smartlink receives the range to various targets, ammunition level (and type), and offers a targeting dot wherever the gun is pointed if within the visual field of the user.
item.thermographic_vision.desc=An implanted version of the thermographic vision enhancement (p. 275). This enhancement enables vision in the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately, and so on. This modification offers a bonus Edge if the opposition doesn’t have a vision enhancement to mitigate limited light and even total darkness.
item.vision_enhancement.desc=An implanted version of vision enhancement (p. 275). This sharpens a character’s vision at all ranges, providing visual acuity closer to that of the average hawk than that of the average metahuman. This system gives a +1 dice pool bonus to all visual Perception tests
item.vision_enhancement_advanced.desc=An implanted version of vision enhancement (p. 275). This sharpens a character’s vision at all ranges, providing visual acuity closer to that of the average hawk than that of the average metahuman. This system gives a +1 dice pool bonus to all visual Perception tests

item.skillwires.desc= Skillwires are a system of neuromuscular controllers that overlay the body’s natural nervous system; they are capable of aiding or completely overriding muscular movement, controlled by the muscle memory played through a skilljack (p. 284). This system allows you to use activesofts with a rating up to your skillwire’s rating, but only if that activesoft is running on your implanted skilljack. \r\nWireless Bonus: With the skillwire’s memory cache expanded, all the skills you use with it receive a +1 dice pool modifier.
item.smuggling_compartment.desc=For items that won’t fit in a fingertip but you still can’t afford to have found, smuggling compartments can be placed in parts of the body that can be easily hollowed out/replaced. This includes ribs and the space between them, hip bones, shoulder blades, and so forth. These compartments allow the storage of small and miniature items (nothing bigger than a light pistol typically; your gamemaster will let you know if something’s too big). The compartment has a Concealability threshold of 8. Inserting or retrieving an object requires a Major Action. \r\nWireless Bonus: Inserting or retrieving an object takes a Minor Action.
item.wired_reflexes1.desc=This highly invasive, painful, life-changing operation adds a multitude of neural boosters and adrenaline stimulators in strategic locations throughout your body to catapult you into a whole new world where everything around you seems to move in slow motion.

item.disposable_syringe.desc=Made of plastic with a metal needle, syringes are intended for a single use. Syringes can be used to apply Injection-vector toxins. An uncooperative victim might need to be immobilized or at least grappled first.
item.medkit.desc=The medkit includes drug supplies, bandages, tools, and a (talkative) doctor expert system that can advise the user on techniques to handle most typical medical emergencies (including fractures, gunshot wounds, chemical wounds, and poisoning, as well as offering advice for the treatment of shock, handling blood loss, and of course performing resuscitations). The medkit counts as Kit for Biotech tests. For rules on using a medkit, see p. 119. \r\nWireless Bonus: The medkit provides a +1 dice pool modifier to healing tests. 
item.medkit_supplies.desc=Medkit supplies need to be purchased after each use or extras can be purchased. Up to five sets of supplies can be stored in the medkit’s case; sets beyond that will need to be carried elsewhere.
item.symbiote_food.desc=Symbiotes have unusual dietary requirements that must be met to keep them alive. You need to pay (Rating x 200) nuyen per month for special symbiote food, although if you have a High Lifestyle or better, it’s covered. If they are not fed, they die in a month.
item.antidote_patch.desc=The antidote patch cancels or negates the Poisoned Status for a broad range of toxins. If a specific toxin or drug is extremely rare, the gamemaster may require a specific Antidote patch just for that substance (see Toxins and Drugs, p. 121).
item.chem_patch.desc=This is a “blank” patch. You can add one dose of a chemical or toxin (p. 121) to it, and then apply it later to a patient (or yourself).
item.stim_patch.desc=This patch removes a number of boxes of Stun damage equal to its rating and cancels the Dazed Status Effect. The effect lasts for (rating x 10) minutes— after that period of time, the patient takes (rating + 1) unresisted Stun damage (which may well become Overflow by that point). While a stimulant patch is in effect, the character is unable to rest.
item.tranq_patch.desc=This patch inflicts Stun damage equal to its rating, resisted with only Body.
item.trauma_patch.desc=When applied, the patient heals 1d6 + 1 Overflow Damage immediately. These patches are always wireless and connect to the Matrix the moment they are applied.
item.liter_milk.desc=The two most common crowd-control weapons you see deployed are Pepper Punch spray and CS/Tear Gas. These are both quite effective at disruption, leaving targets nauseated and blind, easy prey for the follow-up arrests. One of the best responses to this is good ol’ milk. A full liter of milk poured onto one’s eyes will wash away and neutralize the burning sensation and clear out the mucus membranes as an effective, if messy, counter-measure. If you ever wondered why riot professionals always have a jug of milk on their belt, now you know. One liter of milk removes the Nausea status from CS/Tear Gas or Pepper Punch and the Dazed status from CS/Tear Gas with a full action’s application. It has no effect on any suffered Stun damage. 
item.magical_lodge_materials.desc=Used to create a lodge for shamans or a hermetic circle for hermetics, the gear is sold with a bag that holds all the components. Once used, some items are reusable. To reuse parts, it takes a number of hours equal to the rating of the circle or lodge to break down properly, and purchasing the new missing components cuts the cost in half.
item.reagents_per_dram.desc=These powders are used to mitigate some of the difficulties inherent in using magic in the Sixth World. They are sold by the dram and lose potency after use.
item.alcohol.desc=Vector: Ingestion; \r\nSpeed: 1 minute; \r\nDuration: (8 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour; \r\nPower: 6; \r\nEffect: –1 Reaction, –1 Logic, High Pain Tolerance; (p. 72); \r\nRanging from wine and beer to pure grain alcohol and mixed up in a variety of ways to taste good going down, alcohol is used across the world, though these days it’s usually synthahol, a synthetic alcohol used because fermentation and processing take nuyen.
item.bliss.desc=Vector: Inhalation, Injection;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour; \r\n Power: 8; \r\n Effect: –1 Reaction, –1 Willpower, High Pain Tolerance (p. 72)\r\n A tranquilizing narcotic, bliss is an opiate synthesized from poppy plants. It takes its name from the sensations its users feel. Players attempting to roleplay a bliss user may want to focus on the escapist angle, using the drug to block out the chaotic or unsatisfying world.
item.cram.desc=Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 10 minutes;\r\n Duration: (12 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour;\r\n Power: 8;\r\n Effect: +1 Reaction, +1D6 Initiative Dice;\r\n Cram is an extremely popular stimulant. When this drug wears off, users crash and suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). Cram users appear hyper-alert, almost to the point of paranoia. They react quickly, often without thought, and they’re prone to irrational outbursts. Other common side effects are jitteriness and fidgeting.
item.deepweed.desc=Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation; \r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: (6 – Body) hours, minimum 1 hour;\r\n Power: 7;\r\n Effects: +1 Willpower, forces Awakened characters to astrally perceive; \r\n Deepweed is a narcotic derived by Caribbean houngans from an Awakened form of kelp. It’s extremely enticing to the Awakened and is sometimes used to dose targets for possession. Deepweed forces any magically active user to astrally perceive, even if the user is an adept without the astral perception ability. Once its effects have worn off, deepweed users suffer a –1 to all dice pools for the same duration as the initial effect. There are dangers inherent in forced astral perception, such as attracting unwanted attention. Role-playing the effects of deepweed may mean portraying someone who seems not completely “present,” since they aren’t.
item.jazz.desc=• Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes;\r\n Power: 9;\r\n Effect: +1 Reaction, +2D6 Initiative Dice;\r\n Jazz is a stimulant designed to better the odds for run-of-the-mill law-enforcement officers who run up against augmented street samurai. It’s usually taken from a single-dose inhaler (or “popper”). When jazz wears off, the user crashes and is flooded with despondent and miserable emotions, gaining the Dazed status (p. 52) for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effect. Jazz makes people as jumpy and hyper as caffeinated two-year-olds. Role-playing a jazz user means turning it up a notch, portraying someone with too much energy to burn—and too much energy to focus.
item.kamikaze.desc=Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: Immediate;\r\n Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes;\r\n Power: 10;\r\n Effect: +1 Body, +1 Agility, +2 Strength, +1 Willpower, +2D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance (p. 72);\r\n Kamikaze is a tailored combat stimulant. When kamikaze wears off, the user crashes and suffers –1 Reaction, –1 Willpower, and the Fatigued II status for twice the duration of the drug’s Effect. They also suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted).\r\n The repeated use of kamikaze has a destructive effect on the user’s metabolism. Large doses can cause excitement, tremors, momentary euphoria, and dilated pupils. Excess doses (bordering on overdose level) cause anxiety, hallucinations, and uncontrolled muscular movements. Even higher dosages lead to death. Kamikaze users are nearcrazed, filled with a feeling of imperviousness and invincibility, exhibiting almost no regard for their own well-being. They can be entertaining to watch, as long as you’re not in front of them.
item.long_haul.desc=Vector: Injection;\r\n Speed: 10 minutes;\r\n Duration: 4 days;\r\n Power: 11;\r\n Effect: Alleviates need for sleep;\r\n A combination of synthesized hormones and other brain-regulating chemicals, long haul stimulates the brain and keeps the user awake, obviating the need for sleep. A character dosed on long haul can remain awake for four days — without incurring any modifiers from fatigue or weariness. After this time, however, the user immediately passes out and sleeps soundly for 8D6 hours. If the character is kept awake during this period, they suffer from the Fatigued I status (p. 52), as they are afflicted with hallucinations and an inability to concentrate. If a second dose of long haul is taken after the first has worn off, the character can stay awake an additional (1D6 / 2) days but suffers the Fatigued I status. A third dose offers a single day of wakefulness while dealing with the Fatigued II status. A fourth offers one more day with the Fatigued III status. After that, additional doses will have no effect, and the user suffers 12 Stun damage (unresisted) and must crash as detailed above. Long haul cannot keep a character awake past this point, no matter how many additional doses are administered. If forced awake with a stim patch, the Fatigued III state persists until the 8D6 hours of rest (more like a coma, really) have been taken.
item.nitro.desc=Vector: Inhalation;\r\n Speed: 1 combat round;\r\n Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes;\r\n Power: 12;\r\n Effect: +2 Strength, +2 Willpower, +2 Perception, +1D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance(p. 72);\r\n A dangerous combination of potent drugs favored by troll gangers, nitro is a powerful stimulant that can easily kill a user. After the drug’s effects wear off, the subject takes 9 Stun damage (unresisted) and suffers –2 to all tests (including Damage Resistance) for an equal duration. Nitro users feel infused with energy, suffer a diminished attention span, and talk incessantly (including to themselves).
item.novacoke.desc=Vector: Inhalation, Injection; Speed: 1 combat round\r\n; Duration: (10 – Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour; \r\n Power: 12;\r\n • Effect: +1 Reaction, +1 Charisma, +1 Perception, High Pain Tolerance (p. 72);\r\n A stimulant derived from coca plants, novacoke is a highly addictive social drug. After the drug wears off, Charisma and Willpower are both reduced to 0 for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effect.
item.psyche.desc=Vector: Ingestion;\r\n Speed: 10 minutes;\r\n Duration: (12—Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour;\r\n Power: 8;\r\n • Effect: +1 Intuition, +1 Logic;\r\n This designer stimulant is especially prized by magicians and technomancers alike.
